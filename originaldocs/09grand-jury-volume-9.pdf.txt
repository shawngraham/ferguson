1 Someone else is listening and transcribing 
2 what she has to say, but the real evidence is the

8 going to be like two different recordings because 
9 they take a break and then they come back on a

14 Q Do you know where the shots are coming 
15 from at this point? 
16 A I could tell that it was following the 
17 police, so the police was the one shooting the 
18 shots. It was like, my eyesight is coming from a 
19 car area at first and now it's coming from this way.

She's not; is that correct? 
Yes, that's correct. 
Okay. And so when you first, something

11 all happened kind of at the same time. The tires 
12 squealing and your phone ringing? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Yeah. 
And gunshots, which originally you said 
15 three shots is what you heard, is that how you 
16 remember it today? 
17 A I remember hearing a couple of shots, two 
18 or three, yes. 
19 Q Okay. A couple of shots, does that mean 
20 two or does it mean two or three? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
It could have been two or three. 
Okay. And so when you looked out, is this

A 
Q 
Yes. 
And that's your bedroom?

1 figure out, because as many people have said, 
2 sometimes over time your memory changes or sometimes 
3 people influence your memory, not intentionally, but

I know what you saw was horrible and it is 
20 probably never going to come out of your brain, it 
21 will be in there forever and I'm sorry we have to 
22 ask you this many detailed questions. It is 
23 probably something you don't want to have to think 
24 about, but it is important that we get this 
25 information, okay?

8 his car or in a police car when you made this 
9 statement? 
A I was in a car. 10 
11 Q Okay. So now you've given some 
12 information about your phone number and so forth. 
13 And then you start talking to him around page three 
14 about the fact that your boss was going to pick you 
15 up. She was going to pick you up and she was headed 
16 towards me, do you see that? 
A Yes. 17 
18 Q And then you said here on page three, at 
19 the moment I heard a car tire skirrr, like skirrr, 
20 like it hurried up and pulled over. At the same 
21 time she called me to come outside cause I was 
22 waiting on her. 
23 So I saw her, so I looked out the 
24 window and I saw the police. And the first thing I

4 were just getting ready to tell him the first thing

7 Q And then you talk about over in the

9 Right behind those officers. 
10 So you are talking about where you 
11 see right? She's in the Do you 
12 see where I'm leading you down the page? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And she's sitting in her van, yes. Okay 
15 what happens then. Okay. So she witnesses 
16 everything from behind, but I witness it from the 
17 top. 
18 You are on the third floor, right? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Right. 
I looked outside and saw the police the

1 you where you were looking outside, top floor, 
2 second, I'm sorry, third floor. He's trying to 
3 clarify where you are, okay. 
4 And then it says here, you're looking 
5 out the window, right? No, this one. You are 
6 pointing to him where the windows are, right? 
7 Facing towards the police car. 
8 So you are talking about what you 
9 knew. And then you get back to, cause I heard the 
10 skirrr, and I just assumed it was her and she was 
11 calling me. So I was going to grab my things to 
12 come outside to go to work. 
13 He says, okay. And then you say, so 
14 at the moment where, I mean, before I did, I just 
15 looked outside to make sure she was, it was her 
16 waiting for me and I saw a police officer. 
17 I don't know name running toward this 
18 guy. I didn't see the hassle at first, but I did 
19 see him get out of the car and run in a hurry. 
20 The guy was, oh, I'm sorry. I can't 
21 remember his name, but it was a friend of a friend 
22 of mine and , I think you are talking about, 
23 are you talking about Dorian at that point? 
24 A No, I was talking about, they keep telling 
25 me I knew

1 Q So that is actually not 
2 isn't it? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Okay. So he ran and so at that time I 
5 came from that window and I ran to the patio right 
6 there. I open the blinds and I could see past this 
7 corner, so I could see directly there from the 
8 blinds. 
9 So there I saw the man running, I 
10 kept hearing some gunshots. The lady's window 
11 across the apartment complex from mine, her window 
12 got shot cause steady shots fired. 
13 So you're talking about the first 
14 thing you see is the officer get out of his car and 
15 run. And you also mention that I didn't see the 
16 hassle at first. 
17 A Yeah, when I was mentioning that, they was 
18 saying stuff was going on inside a police car and a 
19 lot of stuff. And I was trying to let him know that 
20 before the tires screech, I didn't see anything that 
21 they were doing before that happened. 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
They said there was stuff going on, and 
24 everybody was talking about it and so I did not see 
25 those things that they said.

1 Q Oh, okay. So on page 7, again, we're 
2 talking about how many gunshots do you think you 
3 heard and I think that this is initially, okay. 
4 Well, I've heard three at first. Like as soon as I 
5 heard the skirrr, I heard three gunshots, boom, 
6 boom, boom. And then I came to the window and 
7 before I could exit my house from the balcony to the 
8 actual door, is when I kept hearing more and more 
9 shots. 
10 So I was technically trying to say 
11 behind, stay behind the door, which is why I could 
12 see, urn, him getting shot, but I wasn't present for 
13 the video to be show cause I was all, I was inside, 
14 okay. 
15 And then he asked you some questions 
16 about he wants to understand what you are saying. 
17 So you look out of that far window and there's 
18 s car, right? Right. 
19 And what do you see at that point? 
20 And I saw the man, I'm sorry, by the 
21 man, I mean the police officer getting out of his 
22 car and running full speed. 
23 So again, when he's asking you, you 
24 look out the far window, you see s car, at 
25 what did you see at that point? I saw a man

2 A That's what I saw. 
Grand Jury Volume IX 
October 2, 2014 
Page 44 
3 Q Okay. So if you want to look through 
4 this, I can let you, but I don't recall you ever 
5 telling the police in your interview on the 9th that 
6 you saw anything happen between the officer and 
7 Michael Brown at the car? 
8 A And I didn't make that recollection like 
9 that at first. I have to sit down and think and 
10 process everything that had just happened to me. 
Q And certainly that's understandable 11 
12 because, as I said, you're years old, you've just 
13 witnessed something that hopefully none of us ever 
14 have to see. And I know you were emotional at the 
15 time. 
16 Do you they think it's possible that 
17 that initial recollection was that you didn't see 
18 anything at the car and it was only until after 
19 people were talking to you about it then you started 
20 to think that maybe you saw what happened at the 
21 car? 
22 A No, I know that because I didn't make the 
23 recollection because I didn't know those were the 
24 same people -- person I was seeing. I know that I 
25 hadn't seen Dorian before, I saw him by the 2-door

14 here and where you live right there, right?

13 but yes, it is my sliding glass door.

8 out until after Michael Brown's been shot, correct? 
A Yes. 9

11 to this window, you stay at that window until after 
12 Michael Brown's been shot, correct? 
A Yes. 13 
14 Q And so wouldn't you agree if people were 
15 running in this direction and if things are moving 
16 in this direction, this wall is going to block what 
17 you are seeing, isn't it? 
A For some partially, yes. 18

20 have been able to see? 
21 A Yeah, that's true.

19 heard the first gunshots, whether it is two or 
20 three, and you thought they were coming from the 
21 direction of the police car, and then, you were in 
22 your bedroom at that point, correct?

Yes. 
And then I wrote a note that you just

1 Q And you said in your statement to the FBI 
2 that you had made, you had written down everything 
3 that you had scene shortly afterwards. How long 
4 after it happened did you write everything down? 
5 A Right before or right after I got my 
6 attorney. So that wasn't long at all, that was 
7 within a week or two weeks of it happening, a week 
8 or two weeks, maybe not even that long. 
9 Q And then when they asked you about that 
10 statement, you said that you burned it? 
11 A No, I didn't burn it, I got rid of it, I 
12 threw it away.

Q 
A

You threw it away? 
Yeah. 
Why did you throw it away? 
Because I become really paranoid. Every 
17 day I came home there was a different reporter on my 
18 door and everybody knew where I lived at. And I 
19 couldn't get one sense of peace at all. 
20 So I was getting calls, my family was 
21 getting calls, every day they would come to my door. 
22 I started to get paranoid they are going to find 
23 this and use this. I got this really bad paranoid 
24 feeling, the whole thing was sick to my stomach. I 
25 got rid of everything that I had wrote down.

3 A Yes. 
4 You describe it as arm

A 
It may have been. 
The timing wise was right? 
Yes, it was almost simultaneous. 
13 Do you know if it was the 
14 right arm or left arm that you saw pull away? 
15 A Urn, I think, I want to say left arm 
16 because in the front how the police car was shaped, 
17 that picture is gone. How it was slanted, kind of 
18 slanted and I'm looking toward the front. I just 
19 see a jerking motion moving backwards, I want to say 
20 left arm. 
21 After he jerked back, did 
22 he go forward again and reengage, or was this out of 
23 your view? 
24 A I didn't see anything after that. It was 
25 a very quick glimpse.

9 After 
10 Michael Brown fell, you did continue to observe the

13 A Yes, sir. 
14 Did you see anything that 
15 would indicate that anybody moved or interfered with 
16 anything within that taped off area? 
17 A No, no, they wouldn't let anybody near it.

20 putting the cones down.

15 what it says here. It says, you're responding to 
16 Detective You said, yes, she said they shot 
17 through the window and, urn, the other guy was 
18 unarmed because he put his hands up so to be 
19 compliant, so this is okay. 
20 So I saw the officer running and by the 
21 time I got to the next window, I saw him get down 
22 like, arms up and then get shot afterwards. 
23 When you say here I got to the next 
24 window, I saw him get down. Okay. Who get down,

Okay. 
That's probably, that's the most likely

1 We saw a lot of 
2 news clips also, including the video you shot on 
3 your phone following the incident. 
4 
5 
A Okay. 
So my question for you, in 
6 the video the two officers, and obviously you 
7 witnessed the event, you saw Officer Darren Wilson, 
8 how certain are you in the video that you shot of 
9 those two officers that the one on the right is 
10 Officer Darren Wilson? 
11 A Okay. I'm want to say 99.9 percent 
12 certain. They look nothing alike. You can tell one 
13 was short and kind of chubby, the other one is tall 
14 and more built. He was the only one running and the 
15 only one that had left the scene before everybody 
16 gathered there. 
17 Between the two people, I'm 
18 100 percent sure between those two people, it was 
19 not the guy on left, it was the guy on the right 
20 99.9 percent accuracy. 
21 Of the two 
22 people, are you sure it was Darren Wilson or is that 
23 someone who looked more like Darren Wilson? I mean, 
24 are you sure when you are taping that was Darren 
25 Wilson?

9 Yeah.

And again, I'm confused, 
12 that's why I'm asking you these questions. 
13 
14 
A Okay. 
This is some kind of car 
15 accident or something. I just automatically looked 
16 right out my window and right now I'm looking out 
17 the window to see a police car right in the middle 
18 of the street. I see a young man standing, and 
19 that's what you said earlier today. 
20 So then you go, I couldn't really tell 
21 what was going on. There was a lot of movement, but 
22 then you say I'm looking at pull into the 
23 driveway after the shot was fired. 
24 Now, the shot fired out the window, so 
25 that's my question. Because you go on to say, you

3 chasing him. So I'm looking at the officer.

5 A 
I'm really confused by this. 
Uh-huh. 
6 I just want to know from 
7 page ten where you are talking about seeing him 
8 doing a lot of movement. 
9 A Okay. 
10 Is that where you heard 
11 the first shot because on the next page I'm looking 
12 at pulling into the driveway, a shot was 
13 fired. 
14 A Okay. They did all go on at the same 
15 time. 
16 Okay. 
17 A It was like a movement, it was like the 
18 window, you are looking out the window and then 
19 movement, shot, all of that happening. Out of the

21 
22 
corner of my eye I could see just turning. 
It was all simultaneous?

23 turn, she was probably, I don't know, she was 
24 already right there and she just turned into the lot

20 watching him, I'm not really looking at my phone, 
21 I'm just looking at the things that happen. I have 
22 my phone facing on him so I can get whatever it 
23 could get. I'm looking at him just talk to the

1 type of protocol as other police officers, if that 
2 makes sense. 
3 Like usually okay, I going back to 
4 what I saw. I'm looking at him standing here 
5 talking to the other officer, he's just standing 
6 there looking over the body, just looking like, like 
7 just a weird look. Just looking at it. He then 
8 just starts pacing back and forth next to the body, 
9 not like back and forth, like immediately back and 
10 forth, it was just kind of a slow movement while he 
11 was looking at the body. He keeps walking and 
12 looked backs at the body and then finally just walks 
13 away and just leaves. After he walks out of my 
14 video, I don't see him any more. 
15 Did you 
16 ever see him make like a radio call? 
17 A Yeah, the officer on the left was the one 
18 doing this on his little walkie-talkie or something, 
19 which was connected. He was just talking, Darren 
20 Wilson was talking to him, probably explaining what 
21 was going on. He was just, he was like, I was 
22 outside at that point, but I still didn't hear him 
23 say anything, I didn't hear the exact words.

25 Did he appear to look injured in any way,

I tried to make the distinction, it did

7 could have been the wind making his skin red, it 
8 could have been anything, but I did say that it was 
9 red. 
10 And, yeah, we 
11 are kind of picky. But later in the interview they 
12 asked you about that, and they said it was emotion. 
13 Could it have been worry, could it have been fright. 
14 You said, yes, it could have been one of those. 
15 A Yes, it could have been. 
16 It could have been. You, 
17 at this point, were you trying to tell the people 
18 that were interviewing you that you felt that it was 
19 an emotional red, but you don't recall what kind of 
20 emotion it was?

3 Feel free. If not, I have a question for her. Did 
4 you have something? 
5 A I'm sorry, I just want to make a note of 
6 something I said earlier. While I was outside 
7 filming, I didn't notice the red any more after that 
8 as I was looking. And when I was looking back on my 
9 videos, I didn't notice the red that I had 
10 originally noticed. This is another reason that I 
11 presumed it to have been anger. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. We've asked you a lot 
13 of questions here today. But we may not have asked 
14 the question that you wanted us to ask, something 
15 you may want us to know. Is there anything else you 
16 think it is important for us to know that maybe we

24 There was a white car that was behind

Q 
No. 
What was your impression of the way he 
17 walked toward him? 
18 A Again, like I say, it is hard for me to 
19 speculate how Mr. Brown walked because I don't know 
20 him. 
21 
22 
Q

24 police officer, that's what I'm saying.

Okay.

(By Ms. Alizadeh) From the time you first 
11 saw Michael Brown at the officer's window until 
12 Michael Brown was lying in the street, how many 
13 minutes or seconds do you think that took? 
14 A I would say probably about five, five 
15 minutes, ten minutes at the max, if that. I don't 
16 probably like, I'm sorry, it was probably more like 
17 probably like five minutes at the max.

MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Real quickly. 
(By Ms. Whirley) When Michael Brown was 
21 running away from the officer, I think you said you 
22 heard maybe a couple shots and then Michael Brown 
23 ran?

A 
Q

Correct. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Anybody else? 
11 When he was 
12 walking towards the officer, could you see his face 
13 clear enough to see if there was any kind of 
14 expression, a blank look, aggressive look or 
15 anything? 
16 A No, I could not. 
17 You could not read his 
18 face? 
19 A I could not.

6 spoke to the police or whatever. 
7 A Uh-huh. 
8 Do you know what length of 
9 time elapsed? 
10 A Yes, this happened about, I guess, about 
11 12:30, 12:40 that afternoon. I didn't speak with 
12 anybody until later that night, yes. 
13 It was the same day?

16 
A It was the same day, yes, ma'am. 
Okay, thank you. 
MS. ALIZADEH: But just to be, I'm going 
17 to try to make sure I understand. Were you 
18 interviewed that night or was it just you spoke to 
19 them and said, hey, I saw this and made arrangements 
20 to be interviewed later? 
21 A That's exactly, that's what happened. We 
22 made arrangements to interview later because, again, 
23 we were at and the, he 
24 didn't want to really get into that because my wife 
25 was still kind of emotional. He didn't want to talk

2 So they took our name and our phone

5 came by my home and spoke with me regarding it. 
6 Could you 
7 tell Mr. Brown, I guess his attire, his shorts and 
8 shirt, where they sagging, were his pants kind of 
9 hanging low or do you remember?
