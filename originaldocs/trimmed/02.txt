GRAND JURY HEARING 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. Today's date 
3 is September 3rd, 2014 and it is about, I can't see 
4 my watch, a little before 9:00, 9:55. (sic) This is 
5 Kathy Alizadeh with the Prosecutor's Office and also 
6 present in the room are the 12 jurors and Sheila 
7 Whirley with the Prosecutor's Office and the court 
8 reporter who is taking down everything that's being 
9 said at this point. 
10 Just some preliminary things. First of 
11 all, did everybody get in okay, was there any 
12 confusion, you all got in okay? 
13 
14 
15 
Well, did give you menus for today? 
(All jurors indicate yes.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: What I would like to at 
16 least begin explaining, and we talked to you about 
17 when you want to meet in the future. And we are 
18 going to accommodate you whatever time or date you 
19 would like to meet. Whatever you decide, if you 
20 want to meet, to continue to meet on Wednesdays 
21 because that's what you're used to, we will make 
22 this room available for you on Wednesdays, okay. 
23 We'll do something else with the new grand jury, 
24 they'll meet elsewhere. 
25 So I would suggest that possibly over the

1 lunch break today maybe talk amongst yourselves. 
2 During your lunch break it is not going to be 
3 recorded, you all can talk about amongst yourselves 
4 about future days. 
5 And then maybe at the end of the day today 
6 or after the lunch, we are going to need a list of 
7 some dates. Those dates are not going to be made 
8 public, we're never going to discuss on the record 
9 in advance what dates, you know, you're going to be 
10 meeting, but we'll need to know so we can start 
11 scheduling people. 
12 Keep in mind that unlike typical grand 
13 jury days, we cannot present evidence on this matter 
14 unless all 12 of you are present. 
15 I know you all have the phone number for 
16 the grand jury. If you all make arrangements to 
17 meet on a particular day and then, you know, 
18 somebody gets up in the morning and they're sick, 
19 they've got the flu, you're going to need to call as 
20 soon as possible so we can try to call people and 
21 head them off if they haven't already left their 
22 homes if one of you can't make it, then we're not 
23 going to be able to hear anything that day, okay? 
24 So the 
25 alternates, alternates will not be called in on

1 this, is that my understanding? 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: That's correct, they're not 
3 going to have heard everything that you would have 
4 heard. 
5 Okay. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Typically the grand jury 
7 will hear a whole case in a matter of 15 minutes 
8 maybe, but that's not the case here, so there won't 
9 be any alternates that are going to be seated. 
10 All right. 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: So the way I would like to 
12 progress is that each day when we meet, we're going 
13 to try to be on time and start on time. I think 
14 that's respectful of everybody else. We know you 
15 are dedicating a lot of your time to do this, so 
16 we'll try to be more punctual on future dates. 
17 I also want to tell you as you notice we 
18 have some additional equipment in this room, there 
19 is probably more people in this room than ever 
20 before. I'm probably going to bring in some 
21 additional fans because it will heat up and get warm 
22 in this room. 
23 If anybody at any point feels like they're 
24 feeling, you know, a little overheated, please let 
25 me know because we'll take a break. With this door

1 open when I walk out here it is way cooler out here 
2 than it is in here. If ever you feel like you're, 
3 you know, not being able to be attentive because of 
4 the heat, stop us, okay. 
5 And what I would also like to do is every, 
6 the beginning of every time you meet is to give you 
7 an overview of what to expect for that day. This is 
8 not in the form of like an opening statement where 
9 I'm going to talk about what the evidence is going 
10 to be, I'm just going to give you the names of the 
11 witnesses that we expect to call and who they are 
12 and what we anticipate the content of the topic 
13 they're testifying about. 
14 As you have seen in the past, the witness 
15 will take the stand, be sworn, take the stand and 
16 then I will begin or Sheila will begin by asking the 
17 witness questions. 
18 And I'm not trying to say, I don't want to 
19 discourage anybody from asking any question that 
20 they want to ask, but what I would like to see if 
21 possible, because your questions might be answered 
22 later on in the testimony. Some of these witnesses 
23 are going to have lengthy testimony and at some 
24 point, you know, you might ask a question that I'll 
25 say he's going to talk about that in a minute.

1 If you don't understand something that's 
2 being said at the time, raise your hand, identify 
3 yourself by your juror number and say excuse me, I'm 
4 not understanding what you're saying right now. But 
5 if you have a question that he hasn't, the witness 
6 hasn't seemed to answer yet, if you want to jot that 
7 down in your notes then, you know, at the end, of 
8 course, you know, I will open it up to questions and 
9 Sheila may have additional questions or vice versa 
10 because we are taking turns on putting on different 
11 witnesses because one person can't do all of this. 
12 Are there any questions so far? 
13 There will be times when I'm going to hand 
14 out things to you like maps or reports of other 
15 people just so you can have them for your reference 
16 while you're hearing the testimony. I would 
17 encourage you to still pay attention to the 
18 testimony. 
19 It can be distracting if you are reading 
20 something that's in front of you while a witness is 
21 testifying, you are going to be missing something 
22 that's being said on the stand. Anything that we 
23 give you will be available to you at any time during 
24 the time you're sitting. Certainly for your 
25 deliberations if you wish to have items back that

1 you've seen before, we'll get those to you. 
2 When you do get maps or reports or 
3 anything of that nature, what I would like you to do 
4 is to just write your juror number on the corner of 
5 it, but I don't want you to put any other writing on 
6 it. 
7 If you have notes you want to take, put 
8 them in your notebook because as we've explained to 
9 you your notebooks are going to be private, they're 
10 locked up, nobody is looking at them and they will 
11 be destroyed at the end of the process here. I 
12 don't want you making notes on anything that is, you 
13 know, not your notebooks, okay. Can we agree with 
14 that? 
15 After our last session Sheila and I sat 
16 down and listened to some parts of the testimony, 
17 the mikes pick up very well. Remember last time I 
18 said I wasn't sure how that was going to go? So I 
19 was kind of encouraging people to lean forward. I 
20 think we're not going to have any problem as long as 
21 people keep their voices up, we should be able to 
22 hear everybody that wants to speak. 
23 And if at all, you know, you cannot hear a 
24 witness as usual, you know, you need to raise your 
25 hand, I can't hear you or I didn't hear what you

2 Any questions about that so far? 
3 Sheila, one other thing I forgot. So the 
4 next time we meet, we will need for you to be on 
5 time because Judge who is the grand 
6 jury judge, is going to be here before we start that 
7 day and she's going to read to you another charge. 
8 When I say charge, it is like she's charging you 
9 with an oath, I guess. 
10 That is having to do with the fact that 
11 you're session is being extended. So I told her, 
12 you know, what time I thought we wanted to get 
13 started. You know she's going to be here a little 
14 before that. So if we can make sure that everybody 
15 is here on time so, you know, she doesn't have to 
16 wait around for us. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: What time we talking, 8:00

13 I know she spoke a lot 
14 about secrecy and we all take that very seriously.

14 and have been. Of course, we're not going to 
15 disclose to any media outlet or the public in 
16 general your identities, but your families and your 
17 employers know that you are on the grand jury. 
18 But more importantly, what you are charged 
19 with is that you cannot discuss anything that you 
20 hear in here. So, you know, if you have 
21 conversations with your family or your employers 
22 about, you know, your meeting times and your meeting 
23 dates, how long this is going to take, that's up to 
24 you and I understand that that's something that you 
25 all need to work out with the people in your lives.

1 We would like to get this done as quickly 
2 as possible, but then again, we are not going to 
3 rush anything. 
4 If there is a need to meet until after the 
5 first of the year, that's what we are going to do. 
6 I don't anticipate that, but there is no way after 
7 this whole process is over that anybody is going to 
8 say we rushed anything, okay. I want you to have as 
9 much time as you need, hear as much evidence as you 
10 think you need to hear. If we don't call somebody 
11 that you want to hear from, we'll get them here, 
12 okay. 
13 So for the next meeting we'll start at 
14 8:00, the Judge will give you a charge. Today we're 
15 going to have testimony on the investigation into 
16 the shooting of Michael Brown in the morning 
17 session, hopefully we can get done by lunch time. 
18 In the afternoon today you are going to hear a 
19 regular docket of cases that we need to move through 
20 the grand jury. 
21 After that, we anticipate that all of 
22 your, everything you will hear every time you sit 
23 will just be evidence on the investigation into the 
24 shooting of Michael Brown. 
25 I know this is different than other cases

1 because normally when we've charged somebody with an 
2 offense, you have the charge in front of you, you 
3 can read what the charge is, you can read what maybe 
4 the elements are and you don't have that in this 
5 case. 
6 I understand that that kind of leaves you 
7 not sure how you are supposed to look at this 
8 evidence. 
9 So after this morning session, Sheila and 
10 I will sit down and we will come up with statutes 
11 for you on the various degrees of homicide and there 
12 will be some other relevant statutes on the use of 
13 lethal or deadly force when, and possibly 
14 self-defense statutes, so you will have by the time 
15 you are here next time. We'll have that for you so 
16 you can kind of at least understand the law as you 
17 are hearing this evidence. 
18 We're putting on witnesses in a certain 
19 order because we're trying to make this easier for 
20 you to digest and understand the evidence as it 
21 comes in because unlike a trial, I'm not making an 
22

opening statement. 
the evidence is. 
I can't outline for you what all 
In a trial, you know, a jury gets 
24 to hear that, that's not going to happen here

1 So we're trying to put the evidence on in 
2 a more logical order so you can kind of understand 
3 as the witnesses progress, oh yeah, I remember 
4 hearing about that the other day. Urn, but as it 
5 happens, sometimes we have scheduling issues with 
6 witnesses, and sometimes things might be out of 
7 order. 
8 There might be an occasion where you hear 
9 testimony from a witness and then you say to me or 
10 Sheila, well, you know, what about that, was that 
11 found at the scene? Well, you're just, I can't 
12 answer those kind of questions for you, you're just 
13 going to have to hope you are going to hear evidence 
14 about that and at the conclusion of all of this, if 
15 you have additional questions and you give us those 
16 questions, we will see if we can get those answered 
17 through witness testimony, okay. 
18 I think the best thing for every day is 
19 for us to tell you how your day is going to go. So 
20 today you are going to hear from two witnesses. The 
21 first witness is St. Louis County Detective, 
22 Detective He is a crime 
23 scene investigator. He will testify about what he 
24 did in relation to his investigation into the 
25 incident that occurred involving the shooting of

1 Michael Brown, okay. 
2 We're going to see pictures, and some of 
3 them are going to be graphic and disturbing and I 
4 have to just get that out there in the beginning. 
5 The next witness we're going to hear from 
6 is going to be I will have him 
7 spell that for you. I don't want to misspell it. 
8 He is the medical examiner who conducted 
9 the autopsy on the body of Michael Brown and he's 
10 going to describe his job and what his findings 
11 were, okay. 
12 So with that, are we ready to get started? 
13 Now, on 
14 the times for next week, we want to be in the garage 
15 at 8:00 so we can be here at 8:30, or we want to be 
16 at the room at 8:00? 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: I think you want to be in 
18 the garage at 8:00, that way you can come through 
19 the way you did. That seemed to work very well 
20 according to So be at the garage at 8:00, 
21 unless you hear differently. I will call you if 
22 something changes, but 8:00 in the garage. That 
23 will probably put us at 8:30, ready for Judge

1 told her earlier this week, 8:30, I thought. 
2 From a frequency 
3 or time allotment standpoint for future weeks, what 
4 is your anticipation from a need, eight hours per 
5 week, two days per week if we can do it, how do we 
6 balance with what you have available to present to 
7 us. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: That's going to depend a 
9 lot on your schedule. Sheila and I have talked 
10 about this. It would be great if we could go five 
11 days a week for as long as it takes to get this 
12 done. As I said to Sheila yesterday, we're not 
13 going to be able to do that. 
14 In a typical case we have a year to 
15 prepare to put on evidence and we don't have that 
16 here. And so, and as you may, you know, find out as 
17 the testimony comes in, we may have additional 
18 witnesses that we don't even know about today that 
19 we will have to, you know, present evidence on. 
20 So that's going to be up to you. If you 
21 guys decide well, we'd like to meet for, you know, 
22 an afternoon on a certain day of the week and all 
23 day on Saturday, you know, or we'd like to meet two 
24 evenings during the week, whatever you all think is 
25 best. Understanding that the more often we meet,

1 crime scene unit, here again, subjected to another 
2 10 to 12 weeks of field training and ongoing classes 
3 and training after that. 
4 Q What does a crime scene investigator, what 
5 is your job, what do you do? 
6 A Primarily our number one job is evidence 
7 at various crime scenes that we are requested to, 
8 photographing evidence, collecting evidence, 
9 diagramming scenes, videotaping various scenes. 
10 Q And so you say that you have been a crime 
11 scene investigator now for approximately five years? 
12 A Yes, ma'am. I was assigned to this unit 
13 in January of 2009. 
14 Q And during the time you have been a crime 
15 scene investigator, have you also received any 
16 additional training either through course work or 
17 attending conferences or seminars that are 
18 particularly directed toward crime scene 
19 investigations? 
20 A Yes, ma'am. Everything from interviewing 
21 interrogation techniques, to scene photography, 
22 setting up death cases, forensic anthropology 
23 courses, several things. 
24 Q So as a general rule, before we get into 
25 the particulars of this investigation, it is fair to

1 say that you have to be called to a crime scene by 
2 other police departments or agencies; is that 
3 correct? 
4 A Yes, ma'am.

Q

Q 
Not at all. 
So you have a van that you use? 
I do. 
And it has all kinds of things in there 
11 that you use during your investigation; is that 
12 right? 
13 A Equipment, tools, supplies, those sorts of 
14 things. 
15 Q And so when you are called, are you 
16 on-call, like you could be called in at any time? 
17 A There are 17 of us in the unit and we 
18 work, we cover 24 hour shifts. So at any given time 
19 there is a minimum of two of us St. Louis County 
20 crime scene detectives on duty, 24 hours a day. 
21 Q When you receive a call to go to a crime 
22 scene, you get your stuff, go, and you drive your 
23 van to the crime scene; is that right?

A 
Q

Now, typically when you arrive at a crime

1 scene, what's the first thing you do? 
2 A First thing I would do is contact either 
3 the person in charge of the scene or an officer that 
4 knows what's going on. They would typically give me 
5 a rundown what they know at that time and walk me 
6 through the scene to show me, again, what they know, 
7 what occurred and where it occurred. 
8 Q And so it's, you are not the first officer 
9 arriving at a crime scene, other officers are always 
10 there before you; is that right? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct, yes, ma'am. 
And so you talk with them about what they 
13 know, what they might have already found, correct? 
14 
15 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Urn, and so after you get that 
16 information, is that necessary for you to then 
17 decide what you are going to document, what you are 
18 going to search for and so forth? 
19 A Yes, it helps greatly knowing what they 
20 know and then I can take my time and start digging 
21 further into finding evidence and stuff like that. 
22 But knowing what they know prior to my arrival helps 
23 me establish a starting point for my investigation. 
24 Q And I would imagine every crime scene is 
25 going to be unique, correct?

A Every one. 1 
2 Q And whether it is a shooting or a burglary 
3 or sexual assault, those are all different crime 
4 scenes, correct? 
5 A Yes, ma'am. 
6 Q So after you have spoken with the officers 
7 there and gotten some information, what's the next 
8 thing you typically do? 
9 A I would walk through the scene with them, 
10 they typically would point out evidence that they've 
11 already found or stuff that may have obvious to 
12 them, stuff that other witnesses or victims may have 
13 shown them already. From that point, for homicide 
14 scenes and other death investigation scenes, the 
15 first thing that we would do is videotape a 
16 walk-through from my own perspective. Not with 
17 anyone narrating it or with anyone particularly in 
18 front of the camera, it would typically be just my 
19 point of view walking through the scene from what I 
20 know from that initial contact with the officer. 
21 Q And in these cases given that other 
22 officers are already there before you, is it usual 
23 that whatever they have determined the scene to be 
24 has been taped off with police tape, that yellow 
25 tape that keeps people out of the scene?

Page 25 
1 A Yes, ma'am, generally that's the case. 
2 Oftentimes through the course of an investigation we 
3 may find something, obviously, that's outside the 
4 crime scene tape initially, but typically the crime 
5 scene tape is already up, a scene has been 
6 established for us and then we start our 
7 investigation. 
8 Q And I would imagine that, you know, what 
9 you were hoping for is to have a crime scene that is 
10 undisturbed, uncontaminated by anyone from the 
11 outside who is not involved in the incident itself, 
12 would that be fair to say? 
13 A In an ideal world, yes, that would be 
14 perfect. 
15 Q Does it occur that there is contamination 
16 of a scene either because of police officers being 
17 there, other pedestrians being there, emergency 
18 personnel, first responders being there? 
19 A Yes, absolutely, that's one of the tenets 
20 of crime scene work. That's a theory that anyone or 
21 any person that comes in contact with a crime scene 
22 you can either take something away, but you will 
23 always leave something there, be it footprint, 
24 steps, anything. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
And so after you have done your video

Page 26 
1 walk-through then, what's the next thing that you 
2 do? 
3 A The next thing we do is after we capture 
4 video, we take overall scene photographs. And 
5 again, it is photographs from my perspective of what 
6 is in place when I show up. 
7 If there is a police car that's shown 
8 up or crime scene tape, everything is left in place 
9 from when I get there and I take my overall 
10 photographs from what is in place when I get there. 
11 There is no way I can photograph stuff that happened 
12 before I get there or try to guess what it looked 
13 like before, so the photographs that I take from the 
14 crime scene are actually what I see when I show up. 
15 Q So it would be against protocol to try to 
16 rearrange things so that they were the way somebody 
17 thought they were before you arrived? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am, correct. 
So nobody touches anything once you get 
20 there and you then go through it, photograph 
21 everything as you see it; is that right? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And then after you have completed 
24 photographing a scene, what do you do next? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Once we do the overall photos, we would

1 typically walk through and place down our number of 
2 placards to mark the known piece of evidence that we 
3 have recognized or determined at that point. 
4 After that, we'll start photographing 
5 those pieces of evidence individually and then once 
6 those things are documented, we'll then start moving 
7 things, looking for more pieces of evidence. We 
8 always want to be able to show stuff that was in 
9 place, how you would normally just walk in and see, 
10 there is always going to be hidden pieces of 
11 evidence that we need to move, either a car, you 
12 know, a couch, move cushions on stuff and start 
13 looking for additional pieces of evidence. 
14 And then we just restart the same 
15 process. Photographing it where we found it, 
16 putting a placard in place where we found it and 
17 then collecting it. 
18 Q And then when you collect evidence after 
19 you photograph that evidence, you referenced a 
20 placard, is that, explain for the jurors what a 
21 placard is? 
22 A A placard, I'm sure you have all seen 
23 them, they come in various shapes and colors. There 
24 is typically a hard plastic, for lack of a better 
25 term, with a number on it. And the only purpose

1 that it truly serves is for primarily me to 
2 recognize a photograph, what number of evidence that 
3 I'm picking up. 
4 Any given scene shell casing or a 
5 blood drop somewhere. If you find a picture of this 
6 shell casing 100 pictures later of a separate shell 
7 casing, it would be nearly impossible for you to 
8 determine which was number one and which was number 
9 200. 
10 So a numbered placard is just a 
11 reference for my report writing and my evidence 
12 collection of what I've just took a picture of and I 
13 can reference that in my evidence. 
14 Q So after you have placed your placard and 
15 photograph the evidence items with their placards, 
16 you begin collecting pieces of evidence, correct? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And you always have with you in your van 
19 envelopes, plastic bags, swabs, all kind of things 
20 that you might need in order to properly package 
21 pieces of evidence? 
22 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
And you do that personally yourself? 
I do. Typically in larger scenes there is 
25 always two of us there. One is keeping notes, one

1 is getting the piece of equipment for someone else. 
2 We are working together doing that, but yes, we all 
3 do pick up our own evidence and place it in 
4 individual bags and envelopes. 
5 Q So if it is a particularly large scene, it 
6 is more than one crime scene detective present at 
7 the scene. Is there one of you that takes over that 
8 that is your scene? 
9 
10 
A 
Q 
Correct, yes, ma'am. 
And so the other detectives that are there 
11 are assisting you? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So when you package evidence, do you mark 
14 the packages or envelopes or bags with your own 
15 handwriting and your notes denoting what it is 
16 inside and where? 
17 A As far as the labeling on front of the 
18 various different envelopes that we have. One 
19 person may write that. The one thing if it is your 
20 case, in particular the Ferguson case was mine, some 
21 envelopes I filled out the front information, but on 
22 every envelope we seal it with a piece of evidence 
23 tape so it is closed and that is my initials and DSN 
24 on the back of every evidence seal.

1 packaged separately, is that protocol? 
2 
3 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So after you have filled out the evidence 
4 envelope and sealed it with tape and placed your 
5 initials and DSN on the envelope, do you prepare an 
6 evidence sheet? 
7 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
A receipt? 
Every piece of evidence has a paper trail, 
10 it has a receipt that denotes not only what the 
11 evidence item is, where it was found, but it also 
12 goes to a different part of our crime lab and/or 
13 property control. Our crime lab has three or four 
14 different wings to it, be it firearms lab, the 
15 chemistry lab, the DNA lab, any piece of evidence 
16 that goes to any part of those labs has to have its 
17 own individual receipt. 
18 Q So this receipt that is with this packaged 
19 evidence stays with that item; is that right? 
20 A Yes, not only is the evidence receipt, but 
21 also serves as the chain of custody but everyone 
22 that picks that item up has to sign off on it as the 
23 chain of custody. 
24 Q And it is not unusual for items that you 
25 may have collected to go through a number of

1 different hands to get to its final destination, 
2 whether it be the lab, whether it be the fingerprint

10 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And those people have to sign off on that 
Yes. 
And then when they give it to somebody 
11 else, they have to sign that they gave it, and the 
12 person they gave it to then signs? 
A Yes. 13 
14 Q And until the evidence reaches a 
15 destination where it is going to be examined or 
16 tested, does anyone open that package while they're 
17 handling it? 
A No. 18 
19 Q Would you agree that it is the general 
20 policy of whether it is the St. Louis County Crime 
21 Lab or any other place, that if they were eventually 
22 to receive one of your evidence envelopes and the 
23 envelope tape has been torn or tampered with or in 
24 any way changed from when you initially sealed that 
25 envelope, do they notify you?

1 A Typically. For instance, if I, when I 
2 package a piece of evidence, I would put it into our 
3 vault, especially if it is overnight. Typically 
4 these things happen at night or when the crime lab 
5 is closed. Whoever takes that piece of evidence out 
6 of the vault or in the lab, they are going to open 
7 it. 
8 So they will cut my evidence tape. 
9 When they're done with it and seal it back up, they 
10 put a piece tape over top of it. 
11 Q Let me stop you, you are talking about a 
12 vault that's at the lab? 
13 
14 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So that's after the evidence has arrived 
15 at the lab? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
But the people that may handle it before 
18 it gets to the lab aren't to open that evidence, 
19 correct? 
20 A No, typically I would be the only person 
21 that would handle that before it gets to the lab. 
22 Q Okay. So once it is at the lab and you 
23 said sometimes if it is overnight, they have an 
24 overnight vault?

Page 33 
You can drop evidence in? 
Correct. 
And so you know no one else from the 
4 outside except the lab people are going to be able 
5 to get to that? 
6 A Actually, myself, not myself, but crime 
7 scene detectives and our property control director 
8 are the only people that have access to it. 
9 Q So once the lab people come in, they have 
10 one of you guys have to open the vault for them to 
11 get the evidence out? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then, of course, if they have to 
14 examine it for whatever testing or examination they 
15 are going to do, that's when the first time this 
16 evidence envelope is opened? 
17 A Yes. If at any time there is a problem 
18 with the receipt, be it if you missed a signature on 
19 a receipt or if you have 30 envelopes of evidence 
20 and one of them does not have the seal on it, you'll 
21 get a call, a page, an email, they won't touch 
22 anything until you respond back down there to fix it 
23 before they will accept it as evidence. 
24 Q So the lab is charged with the duty of 
25 checking the chain of custody making sure that is

And then after you have delivered your 
7 evidence items to wherever they're going to go, the 
8 lab, property control, and property control for the 
9 sake of explaining to the jurors, what is property 
10 control? 
11 A Property control, obviously, the name 
12 explains a lot, they control the property. But they 
13 primarily take pieces of evidence that are not going 
14 to be tested by the forensic lab and fingerprints 
15 for that matter. 
16 If it is a recovered stolen bicycle 
17 from the back of someone's yard, that's not going to 
18 go to our lab for DNA testing, that's going to sit 
19 in property. 
20 Q It is what we would think of as an 
21 evidence room? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Exactly, yes.

1 another officer who is in charge of the 
2 investigation, would that be fair to say? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q And do you also take instruction from that 
5 officer on various parts of what you're doing? 
6 A I'm assuming you are referring to like a 
7 detective that's doing the lead part of the 
8 investigation. 
Q Right. 9 
10 A They are oftentimes given more 
11 information, especially throughout the course of an 
12 investigation than what we would typically have at 
13 the scene. They are initially outside interviewing 
14 witnesses and other people, be it even a suspect 
15 and/or victim. 
16 At times what they will do because 
17 I'm given basic information when I show up to the 
18 scene, I'm typically not privy to the ongoing active 
19 investigation. 
20 So other detectives, be it homicide 
21 detectives or anybody else would come into the scene 
22 and go hey, we just found out this. Can you look 
23 for this. 
24 And then I may have a piece of 
25 evidence that I already collected that I deemed

1 important to the case, or I assumed it might have 
2 something to do with it, and I would think to send 
3 it to the DNA lab. 
4 Well, they may find out something and 
5 say can you go ahead and send that to firearms first 
6 before it goes to DNA, can you send this to 
7 fingerprints before going to DNA or vice versa. 
8 So they come in and ask certain 
9 things or ask that things be sent or certain things 
10 be collected that I may not have known about 
11 initially. 
12 Q So, for example, while you are on the 
13 scene, a detective may come up and say, hey, the guy 
14 just told us he threw the knife in the sewer, now he 
15 is going to cause you to go look in the sewer to see 
16 if you can find the knife? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 Q After you delivered all your items of 
19 evidence, then do you make a report? 
20 A I do. 
21 Q And your report is documenting what, 
22 everything you have done at the crime scene; is that 
23 correct?

1 list. It is three sections or sometimes four, 
2 depending on what I do at different scenes. The 
3 first section is an inventory of the photographs 
4 that I took and what they show. 
5 The second section if I took latent 
6 fingerprints or developed prints, I would list where 
7 I found each print, the third section is just a list 
8 of the evidence I collected and where it was 
9 collected, what the evidence item is and where it 
10 was collected and the fourth list, the fourth 
11 section would be if I took video or did diagrams of 
12 the scene, which is me listing those things as 
13 pieces of evidence. 
14 Q Okay. And so lets get to the 
15 investigation that occurred at the scene of the 
16 shooting of Michael Brown. And so you were on duty 
17 on August 9th of 2014; is that right? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And about what time did you receive a call 
20 that you were needed to respond to the scene? 
21 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
A 
Shortly after 1:00 p.m. 
And where were you when you got that call? 
I was actually northbound on I-270 around 
24 Highway 40.

1 scene? 
2 A Urn, I switched my radio over to the muni 
3 north radio, which dispatches for the Ferguson area, 
4 not for Ferguson, but for the munis in that area. 
5 And I heard several reports of gunshots being fired 
6 near the crime scene, so I stopped and put my vest 
7 on. 
8 Q Okay. What was the call involved in the 
9 shooting, what information were you given when you 
10 first got the call? 
11 A I was told that it was an officer involved 
12 shooting with a Ferguson officer and Ferguson had 
13 requested St. Louis County Crime Scene to respond. 
14 Q So this incident happened within the city 
15 limits of the municipality of Ferguson, correct? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And typically that would not be a 
18 jurisdiction that you would investigate in, they 
19 would have their own police department, correct? 
20 A They do. They handle burglaries and stuff 
21 like that. We typically do not go in there for 
22 property crimes. 
23 Q But in this case being an officer involved 
24 shooting, was it unusual for a municipality to reach 
25 out to the County and ask for their assistance or

1 ask them to take over the investigation? 
2 A No, ma'am. We handle those type of calls 
3 for any municipality that ask. We also handle those 
4 calls for any department that uses the Major Case 
5 Squad. 
6 Q So when you said that you, on your way, 
7 heard on the municipal radio channels that there 
8 were shots fired, are you talking about shots that 
9 were being fired after the officer involved shooting 
10 occurred? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
So that caused you to decide to stop and 
13 put on your Kevlar vest? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. I stopped almost immediately, 
15 once I got it put on, I drove directly to the scene. 
16 
17 
18 
Q 
A 
Q 
And so what was the location of the scene? 
I was given the address Canfield. 
So how is it that from where you were 
19 driving you eventually travel onto West Florissant; 
20 is that correct? 
21 
22 
A 
Q 
Yes, that's the round I took. 
And then from West Florissant you turn 
23 onto what street to get? 
24 A You can turn directly onto Canfield and 
25 West Florissant.

1 Q So from West Florissant when you turn into 
2 Canfield, that's a residential area, isn't it? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q And after you travel some distance, not 
5 terribly far, you reach an apartment complex, 
6 correct?

A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
What's the name of that apartment complex? 
I honestly can't tell you. I would just 
10 assume it was the name Canfield apartment complex. 
11 Q So when you arrived, turned onto Canfield, 
12 did you notice a crowd? 
13 A Immediately. The distance from West 
14 Florissant to the scene, if I can recollect, is 
15 probably less than half a mile. And it is a 
16 residential street, all the houses have driveways, I 
17 have been on that street before. There is typically 
18 not a bunch of cars parked on the side streets and 
19 stuff like that, but as soon as I turned onto 
20 Canfield, I encountered traffic basically at a 
21 standstill. 
22 There was some officers that were 
23 directing traffic near the first cross street 
24 because people were pulling in, being told they 
25 can't drive through, trying to turn around and it

1 you arrived? 
2 A I first sought out whoever it was in 
3 charge. I saw some other officers and sergeants 
4 from my own department and I obviously made my way 
5 over to a group of people that were talking. They 
6 were expecting me and I just asked, simply asked can 
7 you tell me what's going on.

9 people, you talking about police officers?

You didn't talk to any witnesses? 
No, ma'am. 
Or anybody in the crowd? 
No. 
And so what did the officers tell you? 
They told me that they had an officer 
17 involved shooting. They were pretty brief with me 
18 initially stating that the officers car is down 
19 there and at the other end of the street is the 
20 victim. 
21 Q When you, now, the initial call that came 
22 out for this, do you recall was this, how is this 
23 determined initially? 
24 A I was told officer involved shooting, that 
25 would be the typical term they would use when

3 packaged and also marked, you write or have 
4 indicated assault on LEO? 
5 
6 
7 
A 
Q 
A 
Correct. 
What does that mean? 
At my point in the investigation it is 
8 obviously right when everything starts and charges, 
9 determinations, names assigned to things aren't 
10 necessarily set in stone. So during my initial 
11 investigation, we are investigating an assault on a 
12 law enforcement officer. 
13 Q Were you told when you initially arrived 
14 at the scene that there was some type of altercation 
15 involving an officer and the deceased? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And was that described as an assault? 
Correct. 
So when you began this investigation, you 
20 were characterizing this as an assault of a law 
21 enforcement officer, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Is that in any way meant to be your 
24 opinion of what happened or who was a victim in this 
25 case?

1 A No, ma'am. Any time I'm involved in an 
2 officer involved shooting, be it a fatal one or 
3 nonfatal, it is always during my initial 
4 investigation listed as an assault on law 
5 enforcement.

7 package on these sheets, you list a victim name?

10 was your victim name on these packages?

Officer Wilson. 
That would be the Ferguson officer? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Again, is that in any way supposed to be 
15 some kind of comment on whether you think who was 
16 the victim of this incident? 
17 A No, ma'am. That's how, when we list 
18 assault on law enforcement, he was the victim of the 
19 assault that we were initially investigating. 
20 Q Okay. So did you immediately learn the 
21 identity of the deceased?

23 form of positive investigation when I started my

2 you did in this case? 
3 A One of the sergeants with Ferguson give me 
4 a brief walk-through to start my investigation so I 
5 can have a logical starting point from where I would 
6 start my video, photographs and looking for

14 things to help the jurors understand what is going

3 A Everyone that I spoke with, the Ferguson

5 end of the crime scene near the victim or the 
6 deceased as it were.

19 times kind of fall backs on common sense. If there 
20 is something, be it a shell casing or piece of 
21 clothing that you know is part of evidence or 
22 evidentiary value, most anyone will typically mark 
23 that, be it with a piece of crime scene tape or 
24 traffic cones, they will set stuff near items just 
25 so one, it is marked and they know where it is at.

2 kick it or move it. 
3 Q So did you notice that there were a number 
4 of traffic cones that were already in this scene? 
5 A Yes, as part of the walk-through they 
6 would say that cone over there is marking what we 
7 think is a projectile or that traffic cone is 
8 marking a shell casing and they would just point 
9 things out to me as we were walking through.

Q So after you did your walk-through, what's 
the next thing you did? 
7 A Urn, typically at that point we would go 
8 back, my van was parked on the west end of the crime 
9 scene just west of where Darren Wilson's vehicle was 
10 at. We would go back there, I would prepare my 
11 video camera, you know, get a new memory card put 
12 in, write some notes down and at that point 
13 typically start my video walk-through of the scene.

Is that what you did in this case?

As far as the exact times, I couldn't tell 
18 you, but during this time when we were heading back 
19 to my car, another round of gunshots were fired and 
20 extremely close proximity to the crime scene. There 
21 was obviously a large crowd reacting to that as well 
22 as a police reaction to it.

24 immediately to kind of hold, make sure that our

3 that's growing ever bigger and more angry by the

9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Is anyone else processing the crime scene 
10 or do anything else or touching in the crime scene 
11 while you take that break? 
12 A No, ma'am. All the manpower there was 
13 utilized to try to secure the crime, just secure the 
14 perimeter of the crime scene. We had officers 
15 10 feet apart, 5 feet apart every inch of the crime 
16 scene tape trying to keep people out of it.

6 walk-through? 
7 A I believe if you want to look at the 
8 picture of the crime scene as a rectangle, I started 
9 at the southwest corner, moved east to northeast to 
10 northwest in a counter clockwise motion. 
11 Q Okay. I'm going to hand you what we have 
12 marked, and I want to make something clear on the 
13 record, I believe the last time we met there was one 
14 item that was marked as an evidentiary item, it was 
15 a report for that witness. Just because to make it 
16 clear, that was, I think, marked State's Exhibit 1, 
17 which is typically what we do in cases. But because 
18 this is a grand jury exhibit, we're going to use 
19 different, call it something different. 
20 So we will at some point re-mark that 
21 report, which was State's Exhibit 1 and that will be 
22 Grand Jury Exhibit 1. Okay, it is State's Exhibit, 
23 it has the typical red sticker that has State's 
24 Exhibit, but it will say GJ 1. We are going to mark 
25 all of ours GJ and then a sequential number.

17 scene that you diagrammed on that day? 
A Yes. 18 
19 Q As I'm not offering a piece of evidence 
20 like I would in trial, I'm just going to put it up 
21 here for your benefit. And I'm going to have to

6 after you completed the video walk-through, what do

1 Q Now, when you're processing the crime 
2 scene and you are taking photographs, do you ever 
3 delete a photograph like if you take it and you look 
4 at it and you see that's blurry or doesn't show what 
5 you wanted it to show? 
6 A No, ma'am. When the flash goes off, that 
7 picture is what it is.

9 times, you have 300 pictures that you send to the 
10 photo lab? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Whether it comes out blurry or 
13 unrecognizable, it is going to be printed, correct?

10 there?

2 This has the date, the complaint number, which is

4 A Complaint number is basically your report

1 0001 and then the next one in order would be 0002 
2 and so forth? 
3 A As far as the DSC number, that's the 
4 number of the photograph on the file card. So this 
5 picture is number one, the next picture would be 
6 number two. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 A The second number that you see 0001, those 
9 are not always going to be in sequential order for 
10 this stack. Different things number, this one 
11 printed up three separate copies. So while this 
12 picture will always be number one, the next picture 
13 may have number four or number eight, whatever 
14 number that photo was print off. 
15 If they printed up four photos of 
16 that one, it would also be DSC1, the second set of

18 number it was in the stack. 
19 Q Okay. So the number that you circled, 
20 which is the first number, that's what we are 
21 talking about, this is your first photo?

23 stamp the back of these. Some officers just use the

2 correct? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. And you can see the corner of 
4 an orange body screen between the two cars, that is 
5 something that I set up after my arrival to assist 
6 in blocking views. 
7 Q Why do you do that? 
8 A A number of reasons one, privacy. Two, 
9 seeing a dead body in the middle of the street is 
10 often disturbing to a lot of people. It is out of 
11 respect for the victim, out of respect for the 
12 family, out of respect for everyone to just kind of 
13 take away a visual sign of stress more than 
14 anything.

16 members of Michael Brown had arrived at the scene,

Initially, no. I think towards the end, 
22 not towards the end, but when the medical examiner 
23 had arrived and were getting ready to move the body, 
24 I believe Michael Brown's father, I think, but a 
25 family member was allowed to step inside while we,

1 the crime scene, while we removed his body as part 
2 of the investigation. 
3 Q So keeping anyone out, including family 
4 members, that's all because you want this crime 
5 scene to be as pristine and undisturbed as possible, 
6 correct? 
7 A That's our goal, yes. 
8 Q And so at this point, about how long into 
9 you being on the scene are we now? 
10 A If I arrived 1:15 or so, probably find the 
11 time stamp on this photo, it is no less than an hour 
12 after I arrived just because in between this photo 
13 being taken and my arrival was when the gunshots 
14 were fired a second time close to the crime scene 
15 and everything was put on hold.

Yes. 
Is that unusual that a deceased person 
3 would be left at the scene for that long of period 
4 of time? 
5 A No, ma'am, that is fairly common, almost 
6 routine. 
7 Q And in this case, you mentioned that there 
8 were a number of times where everybody had to kind 
9 of stop what they were doing because the scene was 
10 becoming dangerous? 
11 A Yes, ma'am. Not only do you have to take 
12 into the fact what we were dealing with at the scene 
13 security and personal safety, but St. Louis County, 
14 who was requested to the scene to investigate, we 
15 were not notified until almost an hour afterwards. 
16 If you look at the time of four hours as a whole, we 
17 only got there a little after 1:00 to start our 
18 investigation. 
19 Q Okay. So now in the photograph, I would 
20 imagine it is fairly clear to everyone, this is the 
21 driver's side of this vehicle, correct?

4 Yes? 
5 , this may be 
6 answered later, I don't know. I just want to know 
7 why is the door closed, do we have any idea why the 
8 door of the SUV was closed or was it reentered? 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: That will probably be 
10 addressed by other people. This detective wasn't 
11 present beforehand and as he had said, his statement 
12 is this is how it was when he got there. So there 
13 will be other witnesses who are going to be called 
14 to testify being first on the scene, what they saw, 
15 whether they photographed anything, but that's the 
16 way he observed it. 
17 Any other questions about Image Number 2? 
18 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Image Number 3, again, 
19 it has got your three on there. Describe what that 
20 image shows? 
21 A This is kind of, I moved slightly east 
22 from the first viewpoint, and typically what I would 
23 do when I'm photographing an overall scene 
24 photograph, I would stand in one spot and just pan 
25 my camera taking this angle, I twist, this angle,

2 pictures out side by side, you would get, in

1 piece of crime scene tape was the barrier to the 
2 crime scene. After several people had torn down the 
3 crime scene tape, run onto the scene, the gunshots 
4 being fired, the crowd would run from this building 
5 in particular from this side of the crime scene, 
6 around this building, through the parking lot to 
7 this side of the crime scene, depending on what was 
8 happening. 
9 We had an opening where the crowd had 
10 run to the eastern end of the crime scene. So 
11 several people moved or put up a new set of crime 
12 scene tape farther back into the parking lot to try 
13 to keep people farther away from the crime scene. 
14 Q Okay. So that was done not because you 
15 determined that somehow this area was now a part of 
16 the crime scene, it was done to keep the crowd from 
17 encroaching upon the crime scene? 
A Yes, ma'am. 18

23 
Q So there's no particular processing of 
this scene, you didn't suddenly say I'm going to go 
and photograph and walk around this area? 
A No, ma'am. The only thing I think that we 
did in that area was film a witness' perspective 
24 with our video cameras and that is even farther back 
25 from where that crime scene tape is set.

4 five. Can you describe for them what you're seeing, 
5 what this image depicts? 
6 A From this angle, I think you are going to 
7 start to see that I am in the middle of what I would 
8 deem the crime scene looking east on the south side, 
9 I'm sorry, looking west from the south side of the 
10 road, and I will start kind of a pan from my left to 
11 my right.

13 police car, the cone that had been set up, my crime

15 scene van was just inside the initial crime scene 
16 tape. You can see a crowd of people gathering there 
17 on top of this hill and, of course, you can see the 
18 amount of vehicle traffic that is now blocking 
19 Canfield.

(By Ms. Alizadeh) Image Number 8. Can you

14 turned further to the east. This is, I believe this 
15 is Caddiefield, at the intersection of Canfield and 
16 Caddiefield. A Ferguson police car, an SUV was not 
17 described to me, was not there at the scene, it was 
18 put in place to block the body. 
19 Where the white sheet is laying 
20 between this police car and the orange body screens 
21 is Michael Brown's body. 
22 I'm not sure what department vehicle 
23 that is, again, it is a police SUV used to block 
24 this street and to assist with security at the crime 
25 scene.

9 where Michael Brown's body is located. The sheet

4 I have a 
5 question, are you by yourself as you are walking 
6 around doing these photographs or anybody with you? 
7 A During the video process of it, since it 
8 is a continuous video, at this particular scene I 
9 typically would have one person, another crime scene 
10 detective that is assisting me walk with me, 
11 basically with a hand on my shoulder making sure I 
12 don't trip over something in a hallway or a street, 
13 because I'm looking directly at that view finder so 
14 I can get the perspective I want to. 
15 This particular case there was, I was 
16 running the video and I had three other crime scene, 
17 two other detectives and my detective sergeant. One 
18 was guiding me so I didn't trip or step on anything, 
19 the other two to get the perspective for the video. 
20 I had to get very close to the crowd. So the two 
21 people that were assisting him were making sure the 
22 crowd wasn't going to grab, push, throw, do 
23 something to us.

20 now moved to the center of the north side of 
21 Canfield looking back east. Again, Caddiefield is, 
22 that's the street sign for Copper Creek Court and 
23 then Michael Brown's body. 
24 Q So Darren Wilson's vehicle is down this 
25 street to the right?

18 Wilson's police car that has the crime scene tape 
19 applied directly to it. The crime scene tape that 
20 you see on the ground again from one of the earlier

7 Q Now, let me stop you here. As a part of 
8 the scene like this type of scene, if you had noted 
9 or scene, for example, tire marks, whether they are 
10 skid marks or marks in the grass indicating 
11 possibly, you know, the travel of the vehicle, the 
12 speed it was traveling and so forth, and you're not 
13 an accident reconstruction person, correct?

Q 
No, ma'am. 
If you had seen tire tracks, like skid 
16 marks around this vehicle, would you have documented 
17 those? 
18 A Yes, that would have been something that I 
19 would have recognized as probably important to the 
20 scene. No tire tracks of any sort, any skid marks 
21 or I didn't notice any and none were brought to my 
22 attention and I didn't document anything. 
23 Q And in preparation for your testimony 
24 today, did you and I look in these photographs and

Okay. As a procedural thing, if I'm going 
20 to do my evidence in order, you can see now you will 
21 see the yellow evidence tents are placed down 
22 throughout the scene. In particular number one. In 
23 a perfect world, you would take a photograph of 
24 evidence number one, you move to number two, number 
25 three just to keep everything in order and that's

1 the order that we find things. There is not 
2 necessarily a rule or law that says the item that 
3 you see first has to be number one and everything 
4 has to go in order. 
5 It could very well, for instance, in 
6 this scene, if I marked number one and number three, 
7 or that's number two there, I could mark 1 through 
8 30 and then when we're getting ready to go find a 
9 shell casing on the other side of number one and 
10 have that be evidence item number 31. So it is not 
11 necessarily in the physical space things are 
12 numbered, they are numbered how we find them.

14 that we've seen and that was kind of your 
15 walk-through of the scene?

Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
Did you take a break and then place

22 after the video is done to show an overall view in 
23 pictures, not just video, of what the scene looks 
24 like when I arrived.

1 walk-through photographs. 
A Yes, ma'am. 2 
3 Q Is that when you then go through the scene 
4 and put placards down? 
5 A At that point I would walk through and 
6 placard items that I know our evidence. Things that 
7 are pointed out to me that were noted by the traffic 
8 cones first responding officers put down that they 
9 saw, and I would put my placards there on those 
10 pieces of items. 
11 During that time you may notice 
12 another shell casing or something else and, of 
13 course, we would placard that. Once those things 
14 are placard, we start taking our overall photos and 
15 close-up of each placard. 
16 Q These items that have a placard, and I 
17 think maybe you can see that that is number one 
18 there, does that correspond with your diagram where 
19 you have a number one with a circle on it? 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
At this point after having documented

9 specifically the order in which we found that piece 
10 of evidence, and the number that's assigned to it is

12 is. Has no other chronological significance.

9 A Yes, I am a firearms instructor for our 
10 police department.

4 anything about that for people that are not familiar 
5 with that? You might want to address that. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: You know what, I would like 
7 to talk about in answer to your question is his 
8 familiarity with cartridges and shell casings and 
9 projectiles and firing pins because he can testify 
10 about that, but as far as like how they're ejected 
11 from a particular gun, how far they travel, I 
12 believe we had this conversation before today, you 
13 feel that is outside of your area of expertise?

1 Are we also to 
2 expect all of these listings for a casing are from 
3 Officer Wilson's gun at the time. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: We will have testimony that 
5 will talked about their comparison. As you recall 
6 he talked about taking items of evidence to the lab 
7 and our laboratory has a ballistics section. So at 
8 some point you will hear about the testing that they 
9 did and they will refer to this as evidence item 
10 three, but to make it even more confusing for you, 
11 the lab will give it it's own number. It will be 
12 like Q7 or something.

14 that this shell casing right there was picked up by

1 vehicle? 
2 A Correct, you can still see the placards 
3 for one, two and three. 
4 Q Okay. 
5 A Image 44. In the previous image I was 
6 standing on the southern side of the road looking 
7 north, and you can see item number four. 
8 What they typically will do again in 
9 a perfect world is you always try to angle your 
10 placards all facing the same direction. So if you 
11 are standing in the middle of the road, you can see 
12 the number of each one because they are basically a 
13 triangle. And turned to the side you can't see what 
14 number it is on. 
15 So in this photo all I did was turn 
16 or moved to my left a little bit so you can see the 
17 front of the evidence placard. 
18 Q Can I ask you, and you can see it also in 
19 Image Number 43, and you can kind of see it in this 
20 image, but there is a thing that's down here that's 
21 yellow? 
22 A I believe that is actually a knotted up 
23 piece of crime scene tape. 
24

Q 
A

So that's not a placard? 
No, ma'am, it is not a placard. I believe

1 initially that was laying down somewhere around here 
2 near this item number four, which is another shell 
3 casing. When and/or something moved or threw it 
4 down on the sidewalk. 
5 Q So that yellow thing right there has no, 
6 as far as you know, no evidentiary value? 
7 A Correct. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
Q You didn't seize it or package it? 
A No, ma'am. 
Q Okay. 
A Image 45. Close-up view of item number 
12 four, another spent shell casing. 
13 Image 46. I've now moved over to the 
14 northern side of the street and this is my overall 
15 view of evidence item number five. 
16 Again, in a perfect world, the 
17 attempt is made to photograph items of evidence in 
18 the order that I find them. 
19 Image 47. Intermediate view of 
20 placard number five. 
21 Image 48. Clarify this as again 
22 another intermediate view. You can still see part 
23 of Darren Wilson's police car, be it that may be a 
24 running board somewhere at the bottom of his 
25 vehicle, again, placard number five.

2 vehicle, the bottom of the vehicle can no longer be 
3 seen. My evidence placard and then a black beaded 
4 bracelet. 
5 Image Number 50. This, looking at 
6 the next photo, this is an overall view of evidence 
7 item number eight, I think the last one we had was 
8 number five. Again, the ideal world you can 
9 photograph everything in sequential order. I 
10 believe items number six and seven were farther down 
11 the street. So at the time that this photo was 
12 taken, I didn't want to move down the street and 
13 then move back. Eight and nine were right in front 
14 of the car. 
15 I stayed in this area to continue 
16 with the photograph, this overall view. What we are 
17 looking at here is a red stain on the driver's door. 
18 Image 51. You can see this is what 
19 we would use as a placard. There is some adhesive 
20 removable stickers that are numbered one through 
21 zero or one through nine and zero that we can make 
22 combination of numbers. Obviously, this is 
23 something that we would typically stick on a vehicle 
24 or a window or something that we can't stick a 
25 placard onto, just to number in our photographs as

1 evidence item number eight. It is denoting a red 
2 stain below that. 
3 52, Image 52. This would be the 
4 close-up view and again, it is not in focus with the 
5 projector, but you can see that the placard number 
6 eight is there, it has a small scale and items of 
7 this nature. We would typically insert my own 
8 visual scale in the photo to show size and shape of 
9 whichever item I'm photographing at that time. 
10 Q Now, Detective all of these systems 
11 so far that you've testified about are all things 
12 that you at some point picked up and put them in an 
13 envelope and packaged them, correct? 
A Yes, ma'am. 14 
15 Q So this is a red stain that is on the side 
16 of a vehicle, correct? 
A Yes. 
Q Did you seize that? 
A I did.

of evidence, we call

24 liquid. I was actually able to seize that with a 
25 pair of tweezers.

17 the driver's side of the vehicle, rear passenger 
18 door, the rear tire here. You can see the placard I 
19 put on there. Again, was an adhesive sticker for 
20 number nine. It is covered up partially by the 
21 police crime scene tape that was applied by Ferguson 
22 prior to our arrival. 
23 Q So to find that item number nine, you 
24 actually lifted up the crime scene tape to look at 
25 the vehicle, but then once you placed a placard on

1 the car, you put the crime scene tape back where it 
2 was? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q So you did move something on the crime 
5 scene, but only to search for evidence? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Image 54. You can see this 
8 photograph, crime scene tape is no longer there and 
9 basically what's happening is I am holding the crime 
10 scene tape up with my left hand and taking the 
11 picture with my right hand. 
12 Q And what is Exhibit 9 or what is your item 
13 number?

15 the driver's side rear door.

21 I use driver and passenger side.

1 photo was shot more at an angle or somewhat of an 
2 angle. This you can see the crime scene tape, I can 
3 no longer hold it up with my left hand and hold my

5 of evidence so I can again put my scale into the 
6 photograph so you can show the size and shape of the 
7 red stain.

Q 
A 
Now, did you seize that item number nine? 
Yes, this particular piece of evidence 
10 appeared to be some type of dried liquid. I was 
11 able to collect it with a DNA swab. 
12 Q So do you have swabs that you carry in 
13 your van? 
14 A Yes, ma'am, sterile swabs from the 
15 manufacturer, sterilized water that we use to wet 
16 it. It is oversized professional Q-Tips. We wet 
17 the end of it, that piece of evidence we were able 
18 just to collect it with a Q-Tip and put it into a 
19 package and submit it. 
20 Q The entire time you are at the crime 
21 scene, are you wearing latex gloves? 
22 A Yes, 90, 95 percent of the time if I'm at 
23 my van doing paperwork, it is not always easy to 
24 write paperwork, but any time I leave my van, 
25 majority of the time between collecting different

21 do with them? 
22 A Number eight, since I was able to take it 
23 off with as a whole with tweezers, it was put on a 
24 piece of what we refer to as way paper, kind of wax 
25 paper. This is in our sterilized kit. It is folded

1 so it doesn't get lost. And that folded piece of 
2 wax paper is then placed inside of a coin envelope 
3 and that envelope is sealed. 
4 Item number nine, since we use 
5 Q-Tips, we have these basically long Q-Tip boxes and 
6 again, they are provided by our crime lab. They 
7 come from a sterile environment, they are inside our 
8 DNA kit. You don't handle them without gloves. 
9 Each individual swab, be it a touch DNA swab or 
10 swabbing of a red stain or buccal swab to collect 
11 someone's DNA goes into its own individual swab box. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: And then what do you do with 
13 it? 
14 A Once they are in the swab box, they go in 
15 an evidence envelope.

1 investigation just because we were told that there 
2 was a struggle in and/or around the police car. 
3 This was an item of evidence like hey, that mirror 
4 may have been pushed during the struggle. You make 
5 sure to note that in your photos. 
6 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So this would be an 
7 example that somebody had pointed out this may have 
8 some relevance to the actual incident and so go 
9 ahead and photograph that and document it? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So the mirror on that police car, is it a 
12 mirror that can move? You don't break it by moving 
13 it? 
14 A No, it is not broken, it is like many new 
15 cars nowadays, it swivels and moves front to back. 
16 Q If you are sitting in the driver's seat, 
17 the mirror is pushed forward to the front of the 
18 vehicle? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
If you are sitting in the driver's seat,

A 
And this thing right here, what's that? 
That would be the spotlight that's 
4 accessible from the driver's side you operate with 
5 your left hand. 
6 Is that mirror intact or 
7 is it broken? 
8 A It is intact. The next photo is a little 
9 bit closer up so you can it. 
10 Is the driver's 
11 side window open or closed, I've haven't been able 
12 to tell in the photos? 
13 
14 
15 
A It is not there right now, it is down. 
It is open. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Did you determine that the 
16 window was broken? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
It had been broken out. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) The driver's side window 
19 is broken and there is no glass in the door frame of 
20 the driver's side window; is that correct?

1 down or be halfway up is not there. 
2 To clarify there is no 
3 glass fragments outside the car or inside the car, 
4 it was all contained within the vehicle. 
5 A No, we talked about this. There is 
6 definitely glass inside the car. You can see broken 
7 glass in the seat and the floorboard. To my 
8 knowledge, I do not remember glass outside of the 
9 car.

7 whose fingers are flying a million miles an hour. 
8 Let me just finish up talking about this and we can 
9 take a little break for sure and everybody else can

And so this door is metal, correct? 
Yes. 
Can you describe what that defect appears 
18 or looks like to you, not what you concluded it is, 
19 but describe it? 
20 A For lack of a better term, this is convex, 
21 it is coming out of the vehicle. It is not a dent 
22 in the vehicle. And it is also, it is hard to tell 
23 again what you are seeing up there. 
24 It is not a stain that's on the 
25 vehicle, you can tell that paint has come off of the

13 Why is it 
14 not notated on here?

It isn't. 
A The vehicle was taken as a piece of 
18 evidence and processed at the crime lab by another 
19 detective, but at the scene that's just a visual 
20 note that I was taking. It wasn't a piece of

Next photograph is Image Number 63. This 
2 is again, what I took an overall photo and what we 
3 are going to zoom in on is hand impression that is 
4 on the rear of Darren Wilson's police car. This is 
5 from east looking west on Canfield. This is my 
6 crime scene van at the edge of the crime scene. 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Okay. 
8 A Image 64, rear of the vehicle, the rear 
9 glass of the vehicle. This would be kind of the 
10 left side or driver's side of the vehicle on the 
11 rear lift gate. 
12 Again, it is hard to see from this, 
13 not only this photograph but kind of this angle it 
14 looks like a couple handprint impressions kind of on 
15 the glass. 
16 65. What I did in this image is I 
17 moved just to my left a little bit to combat the 
18 reflection of the sunlight, daylight that was there 
19 to get a better image of what I was seeing in person 
20 to describe what this is. It is not a bloody 
21 handprint, it is not a muddy handprint, it would be 
22 if the window was clean and somebody slapped a wet 
23 hand on there and went down a dusty road, all it is 
24 is a dust impression of a hand. 
25 After I photographed this, almost

1 immediately a Ferguson officer, I don't know who, 
2 came up to me because they noticed me photographing 
3 this and were trying to figure out does this apply 
4 to the scene? Does it not apply to the scene? I 
5 had noticed it and considered I better document it. 
6 After I photographed it, somebody came up to me from 
7 the department and goes hey, just so you know, 
8 Darren was told during roll car to get his car 
9 washed because the sergeant saw the handprints on 
10 the back window. 
11 It was obviously deemed at that point 
12 not of evidentiary value to us, but I had already 
13 photographed it, so the picture shows what I took. 
14 Q So had you thought that might have some 
15 relevance, you would have maybe tried to lift a 
16 print off of there? 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
I would have done a number of things. 
I don't want you to belabor it, you didn't 
19 act any further on this handprint because it was 
20 told to you it was there earlier in the morning? 
21 A Correct. We did nothing other than the 
22 three photos that you just saw. 
23 
24 
Q 
A 
Okay.

25 the vehicle itself. I think if I remember the time

1 limit correctly, we were told that the tow truck was 
2 close trying to gets its way down Canfield so we can 
3 tow the vehicle away. 
4 Image 67. Same thing. Just overall 
5 image of the vehicle before we were getting ready to 
6 tow it. 
7 Image 68. Right before this image 
8 was taken, my chain of events kind of got scattered. 
9 I would have typically have continued photographing 
10 the vehicle and then once it was towed I would have 
11 taken a picture of where the vehicle was at right 
12 after it had been removed. 
13 Someone, I'm not sure who, be it 
14 family member or someone in the crowd, had tore down 
15 some crime scene tape and a few people ran into near 
16 the crime scene. The decision was made then that we 
17 needed to stop our order of events, how we typically 
18 process a scene and we needed to get the body 
19 photographed and get the body moved immediately. 
20 Typically what you would see in the 
21 beginning of the photographs were I had the overall, 
22 the intermediate and close-up view of each 
23 individual piece of evidence, that got thrown out 
24 the window. 
25 We not quickly ran down, but we had a

1 large crowd that had gathered now at the end of the 
2 crime scene near Michael Brown. The apartment 
3 buildings that you can see on either side, one in 
4 the front, there is one obviously behind me where 
5 I'm taking this picture. Those were filled with 
6 residents on the three stories of the stairwells. 
7 There were people on roofs, people had started to 
8 line the crime scene from the side not being 
9 blocked. 
10 What we decided on doing is the 
11 medical examiner, I think the fire department that 
12 was there had sheets and some tarps that we were 
13 going to use because the crowd at this point were 
14 starting to chant, kill the police, numerous other 
15 derogatory things towards everything about us. And 
16 we fully expected another, I don't want to use the 
17 term riot, but an outburst once we did uncover the 
18 body and begin to move it. 
19 We made the decision to use the 
20 sheets and tarps the best we could to block the view 
21 of everybody that was trying their best to get in 
22 the crime scene and see what was going on. 
23 Several officers that were there, I 
24 would say probably 10 to 15 officers grabbed the 
25 body screens, sheets, and tarps, and not just held

1 them on the ground, but held them up above their 
2 heads because the apartment buildings were very 
3 close to where we were at. 
4 It is hard to really get a 
5 perspective from this view how close those buildings 
6 were to the scene. We had people on the third floor 
7 apartments that could see straight down, and people 
8 on roofs that could see straight down. 
9 So we had people in close proximity 
10 of the perimeter of that body holding screens to try 
11 to block us while we're working and still trying to 
12 protect the crime scene as well. 
13 Q So this blocking maneuver I'll call it 
14 that you did, was this done so that you were hiding 
15 some of the things that you were doing or was this 
16 done so you could avoid inciting the crowd with what 
17 they see when you remove the sheet? 
18 A It was strictly done to avoid any type of 
19 emotional response that we were expecting to happen 
20 when the body was uncovered. 
21 Q You also refer to the medical examiner 
22 being there? 
23 A It was medical examiner field 
24 investigator, not one of the pathologists.

3 that you, it disrupted your normal course of order? 
4 A Yes, ma'am.

6 next image. 
7 A 69. The first, the previous photo would 
8 be the overall view, this would be just the 
9 intermediate view of me stepping closer to the body. 
10 Again, just kind of drawing your attention to what 
11 we are getting ready to photograph. 
12 Image 70. This image, obviously, 
13 Michael Brown has been uncovered, the sheets have 
14 been moved from here to this end of the body, you 
15 can see now people's feet, which I would typically 
16 just out of habit try to keep people out of my 
17 photographs, but again, I'm standing in between 
18 policemen now, kind of my back against, with the 
19 scene secured and kind of collapsed down on top of 
20 us to shield the public's eye. 
21 Image 71.

1 trying to show you. I do the same thing with a 
2 victim or Michael Brown. 
3 So before I was standing over here on 
4 the right side of the picture looking this way, now 
5 I'm looking at his feet, I'm standing on the eastern 
6 end looking to the west. 
7 Image 72. Same thing, the previous 
8 image I was standing probably on the double yellow 
9 line, now I've moved slightly to the south and again 
10 you can see the feet of the policemen that are 
11 standing around holding the screens. 
12 Image 73. I'm on the south side of 
13 the street looking north and again just kind of an 
14 overall intermediate view. This picture in 
15 particular you can see that I cut off part of his 
16 foot in the photograph. 
17 Q You mean out of the frame of the 
18 photograph? 
19 A Out of frame, I did not cut part of his 
20 foot off. In the photograph his foot is out of the 
21 frame. 
22 Q You see the white sheet is still above his 
23 head? 
24 A Yes. Image 74. Corrected the previous 
25 photo by including his entire foot in the frame.

1 Image 75. An overall view, again, I 
2 put in the center of the overall view kind of where 
3 I'm going with the next information so this would be 
4 in our processing of the scene. We do as many face 
5 shots and identification shots as the body is found. 
6 Q Now, when you are processing a death 
7 scene, is it common place when you first see the 
8 body and document it that there might be evidence of 
9 medical intervention, people that might have been to 
10 a scene and tried to provide medical aid to a 
11 victim? 
12 A Yes, ma'am, anything from people being 
13 intubated with a breathing device, to clothes being 
14 removed for CPR purposes, to just the simple EKG 
15 type of devices attached to the feet to check to see 
16 if there is a heartbeat. 
17 Q In your experience in those circumstances 
18 that when there is some type of medical 
19 intervention, when the medical personnel are done, 
20 they leave those devices at the scene? 
21

13 Image 79, what I would determine an 
14 intermediate view of his right hand and the defect. 
15 Image 80. Moving farther up the 
16 right arm, that would be a defect injury to his 
17 right forearm. 
18 Image 81. This would be kind of 
19 moving back again, as far as my perspective because 
20 I'm starting to show the tattoo and injury to the 
21 inside part of his right arm.

19 anything else, we always show lack of injury as

1 images that were requested by the detectives after 
2 they had spoken with Darren Wilson and we kind of 
3 had a brief, we had his first initial statement they 
4 requested these photos as part of his statement. He 
5 had said that Michael Brown had come back towards 
6 his direction with a hand stuck into his waist band,

19 to the medical examiner. What we investigate on the 
20 body at the scene is very minimal compared to what 
21 they do at autopsies. If there was a knife sticking 
22 out of his hand, something that is protruding, I

12 laying on is not one of the sheets he was covered up 
13 with, this is a new sheet, and lack of a better

13 A Okay. Again 360 degree view from his head 
14 looking towards his feet. Again, you can kind of 
15 get perspective now the policemen that we had 
16 blocking the scene. 
17 Q You see those weighted sand bags along 
18 here for the body screen? 
19 A Yes, just like we saw in the previous 
20 images at the beginning of my photos where that 
21 weight was kind of left in the middle of the street.

23 
Q 
A 
Do you know what this is right here? 
I think that's another sheet that had been 
24 used to cover him or part of it. There was more

13 those things where my camera clicked twice. I know 
14 at this point there is some items sitting on his 
15 stomach, this is where the investigator from the 
16 medical examiner's office had removed some items 
17 from his pocket to show what he had in his pockets 
18 there. 
19 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, is it typical at a 
20 scene that do you ever go inside the pockets of the 
21 deceased person? 
22 A No, again, in the State of Missouri the 
23 deceased body belongs to the medical examiner's 
24 office in St. Louis County or to the coroner in 
25 different counties, however they are titled. Body

16 A Yes. 
17 Q Is that something that's typically done 
18 that the items were placed on the deceased body? 
19 A Given space and time, they are either 
20 placed on the body or if it is a large amount of 
21 things they would be placed directly next to him

And so we're going to resume again with

15 So you can resume with the next 
16 photograph? 
17 A Image Number 100. This is a standard 
18 photo that we take during any death investigation 
19 photograph of where the body was after it had been 
20 removed by medical examiner personnel. 
21 What you can start to see in this 
22 photograph are again the chalk markings we put in 
23 place while the body was still there for our 
24 measurement points. Also you can see an evidence 
25 placard here again, once we collect evidence, the

1 placard is left in place for us to measure and 
2 diagram from later. 
3 Q Now at this point, have you collected all 
4 of the evidence? 
5 A At that point we had collected everything 
6 that we had found. I had mentioned before in an 
7 ideal world you see the overall, intermediate and 
8 close-up view of each individual piece of evidence. 
9 The shell casings, projectiles and some other items 
10 of evidence that were around the body in the chaos 
11 of the gunshots being fired near us, people tearing 
12 down our crime scene tape and coming in, those shots 
13 were missed, the photographs, the images, I'm sorry, 
14 were not taken prior to us picking up those items of 
15 evidence. We got them out of there to protect those 
16 pieces of evidence and just didn't get photographs 
17 of them. 
18 Q But you did document them in your diagram, 
19 correct? 
20 A Yes. The last photo, the previous one 
21 that was up there you can see the evidence placard 
22 is still there. You will see it in some of the 
23 following photos too, you will see the yellow 
24 evidence placard still in place.

1 front of it, but the placard is still where the item 
2 was located for measurement purposes. 
3 Q Now, something that we talked about this 
4 morning, and you and I had a brief conversation out 
5 there about something that you recalled, I asked you 
6 earlier when you were photographing the body of 
7 Michael Brown up close and going to start moving the 
8 body, uncovering it and moving it, you had officers 
9 that were shielding you with sheets and tarps? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And the body screens that you call them? 
Yes. 
I had asked you if that was done to 
14 conceal what you were doing from public view and so 
15 that people wouldn't see what you were doing? 
16 
17 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And you had described that's not the 
18 purpose for why you were being shielded, was there 
19 any civilians who were allowed inside that shielded 
20 area once you uncovered the body of Michael Brown? 
21 A Yes, after we had put the shields up, the 
22 tarps and the sheets to block the outside people 
23 looking in from above our vantage point, Michael 
24 Brown's father, Michael Brown, Senior was allowed 
25 inside the crime scene and actually inside the group

1 of tarps to witness and observe what we were doing. 
2 That served multiple purposes, 
3 primarily to provide positive identification. Would 
4 be no different from any other homicide scene where 
5 we would have a family member provide us with 
6 identification once we do go in and uncover the body 
7 and everything else, just like the photographs that 
8 I showed you of the tattoos on his arms, those were 
9 things that the family told us to look for when 
10 identifying him, but it served no other purpose than 
11 letting him observe what we were doing and give us 
12 positive identification of his son. 
13 Q He wasn't allowed to touch anything in 
14 that inner circle as you called it? 
15 A No, ma'am, he stayed basically on the 
16 inner perimeter that we had created. 
17 Q Did he positively identify the body in the 
18 street as his son? 
19 A Not to me personally, but to the detective 
20 he was with, yes.

22 duration of the time that Michael Brown's body was

10 Image 102. Same thing as before, 
11 north side of the street looking south again, feet 
12 and hand chalk markings. A couple things you can 
13 see in this photograph are number one, a pile of 
14 blue tarps on this side. Those are some of the 
15 tarps that we used to shield the view of the public 
16 that was around us. Wrapped up in there are some 
17 white sheets that were used as well to shield the 
18 views, not the ones that I know of that were used to 
19 cover the body. 
20 Also things that you see in this 
21 video here are, image right here is a box that we 
22 use to hold our placards and a large 250 foot yellow

We were looking for two. 
And had you also been told now, initially

A No.

1 you were interrupted what you had been doing, what 
2 event had transpired? 
3 A At this point after the body had moved, we 
4 had learned the information of how many rounds he 
5 had fired, which were 12. We had found ten shell 
6 casings and we were continuing to look at the 
7 eastern end of the crime scene where the body was 
8 at. We were looking around the western end where 
9 the vehicle was at, unknown how many shots were 
10 fired at which location. 
11 The vehicle was getting ready to be 
12 towed and to save us time spent here closing down 
13 this entire apartment complex, we were trying to 
14 determine if possibly the shell casings were inside 
15 of his police car because we hadn't been in to 
16 search it yet because we had made the determination 
17 to tow it and process it at our lab, but that could 
18 take a couple of hours from start to finish. In the 
19 meantime we could be searching for two casings that 
20 just left our crime scene. 
21 So I talked with the detective that 
22 was going to process his car and we, not quickly, 
23 but we briefly opened the door where I photographed 
24 the hole that corresponds with the dent on the 
25 outside of the door and then we went through just

1 Wilson's car. So we are standing at the eastern end 
2 looking west. What these other items are, are two 
3 blood spatter patterns that are located farther east 
4 of Michael Brown's body on the ground. 
5 Image 125.

7 you said blood? 
8 I did. A 
9 You didn't test it? Q 
10 I did not test it. A 
11 So it is called red stains? Q 
12 Yes. A 
13 Somebody else will testify about what it Q 
14 was? 
A 15 It is a red stain similar to a spatter 
16 pattern that I would recognize as needing to be 
17 documented and possibly important to the case. 
18 Q You've seen crime scenes before where 
19 there are blood trails or blood spatter, and you 
20 know that sometimes those spatters can give you some 
21 information about what was going on when that blood 
22 was dropped onto that surface?

24 scenes. I've taken several classes on recognizing, 
25 interpreting and the correct way to document these

11 get to 12 shell casings. The first thing you will 
12 see in this image number one is the Ferguson car is 
13 still here, we have pushed the crime scene back at 
14 this point in time. Here again is the pile of tarps 
15 and sheets that we used to shield the view of the 
16 public. You can also see these are evidence 
17 placards for 11 and 12. Those are other shell 
18 casings that we found previously and had already 
19 collected. 
20 This is the end of our, towards the 
21 end of my investigation here for physical evidence 
22 and it shows that we never stop in the order that we 
23 find them. Obviously, 11 and 12 wouldn't 
24 necessarily be next to 21 and 22, with 15 being over 
25 here. It is just the order we found it at. The

15 metal detector. They're primarily used for finding 
16 shell casings and heavily grass areas or other 
17 pieces of metal evidence. We have used them before 
18 to look for projectiles, we understand that when a 
19 bullet is fired, a projectile doesn't stop 
20 necessarily for a lot of things, including the 
21 earth.

1 ground, it is going to be so deep, it would take a 
2 lot of manpower and/or just work to get it out and 
3 not guarantee that you will actually be able to 
4 recover it. 
5 Q I guess for the sake of understanding 
6 this, when shell casings are ejected, you know they 
7 travel in a predictable direction and somewhat in a 
8 perimeter that doesn't go beyond a certain area, 
9 like you are not going to look in the next block for 
10 a shell casing?

18 account for. 
19 This was a defect that was brought to 
20 our attention by a witness that from what I can 
21 testify to wasn't there when the shooting occurred, 
22 but lived in this building and brought this to our 
23 attention. I think there is a bullet hole in our 
24 siding.

1 photo was taken. I took out about a 6 foot section 
2 of her siding and the insulation that's on it. 
3 Behind it is three quarter inch of plywood and then 
4 in between the plywood there's about a 4 inch gap 
5 and goes into solid concrete cinder block wall. 
6 I could see inside of it that 
7 whatever that was that caused that hole was not 
8 sitting behind there and this was above the window 
9 and it was open behind there. 
10 To continue to look for apparent 
11 projectile that might be in there I would have to 
12 remove that siding all the way around to that 
13 window, the plywood all the way around and cause 
14 significant damage to that apartment building. 
15 Again, without guaranteeing any hope 
16 of actually finding something because I've done this 
17 more than once into just a drywall piece where you 
18 see this and you take it all out and realize that it 
19 just caused that hole and skipped off somewhere. 
20 I've also seen where things have gone through 
21 something like that three or four layers of wood, 
22 hit something concrete, you get it, it just looks 
23 like a penny and it just smashed.

1 the point you can't confer anything from this then. 
2 So we made the decision at that point, after I had 
3 removed the siding to not do any more damage to this 
4 lady's outside of her apartment.

Anything. You can tell it is not exactly

11 with a firearm. Not to say that a firearm couldn't 
12 do that, but it could have been anything. There was 
13 no guarantee or eye witness that said I was standing 
14 here when this happened and this is brand new 
15 damage. 
16 This, in fact, we walked around that 
17 immediate apartment complex and found a few other 
18 damages and defects to siding that had cobwebs on 
19 this and could tell they had been weathered or old

Final photos is Image 161. I explained at

3 photos that we take in our memory cards for our 
4 photo technicians when they look at our files to 
5 know what the beginning and ending of the scene is. 
6 Q All right. I have two other areas to 
7 cover very quickly. Going back to Grand Jury 
8 Exhibit 2, this is your diagram. So you've already 
9 testified that one of the last things, let me ask 
10 you this, after you've done the photographs and 
11 seized all the evidence that you described, what's 
12 the next thing you do? 
13 A Now we start diagramming. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 A Photograph our evidence, selected our 
16 evidence, accounted for every piece of evidence that 
17 we know of at the time. The body has been moved, 
18 cars have been towed, we go back now to diagram the 
19 scene. 
20 Q All right. Now, on Grand Jury Exhibit 
21 Number 2, is this the diagram you made of this 
22 scene? 
23 
24 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so we referenced this before, you have

A Correct. 1

3 
Q What does that mean, not to scale? 
A The items in this photo that are not to 
4 scale would be obviously number one, the size and 
5 shape of these apartment buildings, we have them 
6 just as plain rectangles. The size and shape of the 
7 width of the road as compared to the size of the 
8 vehicle. 
9 If you look as far as scale drawings 
10 go, this vehicle is the same size as Michael Brown 
11 here. Those things are hard to do with the software 
12 we're given and the tools that we use as crime scene 
13 detectives to draw into scale on a CAD type drawing. 
14 Also the size of this entry point on 
15 Caddiefield, the driveway is not the same size as 
16 this one. They may be in real life, but whether we 
17 measure to scale or measure for our plotting 
18 purposes of evidence, we don't measure those types 
19 of measurement. 
20 You can see down here in the lower 
21 baseline starting at 0.0 feet. 
22 How we do the diagrams is I took a 
23 long screwdriver and at the corner where Copper 
24 Creek Court comes into Canfield, I drove a 
25 screwdriver down into the dirt and hooked my 250

1 foot measuring tape and 0.0 there. Then from the 
2 edge of the road from Canfield, run from 0.0, we run 
3 that tape measure out as far past our last piece of 
4 evidence that we need to. If you look on page two 
5 of the diagram, it has the measurements and lists of 
6 evidence that was collected. 
7 How this is measured and the reason 
8 why we do this diagram is one, to kind of show a 
9 visual picture of the scene, but two, if we ever 
10 needed to go back and put evidence back in place, we 
11 can easily go back and do that with very little 
12 effort. 
13 As basic as it is, if you look, I'll 
14 use evidence item number 19 I believe is the 
15 farthest one away, you will start at 0.0 and the 
16 your first measurement you will see is listed as. 
17 Q You all have your diagrams and probably 
18 easier to look at the overhead. 
19 A So I will use evidence item number 18 as 
20 my example, or 19, it is even number. If you look 
21 on the diagram, evidence item number 19 is the 
22 bubble here that is farthest to the east. 
23 The first column of measurements 
24 shows baseline west from Copper Creek, so if you 
25 look at the baseline measurement here and walked

1 west 31 feet and stopped, in the second column of 
2 measurements shows 11 feet 9 inches south of the 
3 baseline. So if you measured 31 feet west, 11 feet 
4 9 inches south, that spot right there is where 
5 evidence item 19 is at. 
6 You do that for every piece of 
7 evidence, even down here the ones, the shell casings 
8 we found in the grassy area, evidence item 22, you 
9 are 47 feet 4 inches west of the baseline and then 
10 31 feet 3 inches south and you'd find the exact spot 
11 where that evidence item was placed. 
12 The measurements, we did those 
13 intersecting measurements for items number 1 through 
14 22. 
15 Q Let me stop you. Do those include items 
16 like eight and nine, which I think were on the 
17 vehicle? 
18 A Yes. If you will notice eight and nine do 
19 not have measurements on them because those were 
20 found on the police vehicle on the driver's side 
21 door. So in the second section of marked, it is 
22 labeled Ferguson Marked Police Vehicle Number 108, 
23 you will find the measurements for the location of 
24 each of the four tires from the west baseline and 
25 south of baseline measurements. And from there we

1 could --
Q You could put the car back? 2 
3 A We could put the car back where it was at 
4 and show you by photographs where those red stains 
5 were located. The same for Michael Brown's 
6 location, the same exact technique for west from 0.0 
7 baseline, and south left foot and right foot, left 
8 hand, right hand and head, and then on the bottom it 
9 has a sentence that states again, the baseline runs 
10 east to west on north side of Canfield Road, which 
11 0 feet 0 inches stops and Copper Creek Court. 
12 That's how we do diagramming situations. 
13 So to label this not to scale is 
14 because these things, if you blew it up to life 
15 size, this might not be 153 feet or 152 feet 
16 9 inches. To show you the reason why we put that on 
17 there is to give you the scale of this size of 
18 thing. 
19 Q So just to clarify though, that distance 
20 that is between that you already testified about and 
21 it is blurry here, but the distance from this point 
22 to this point? 
23 A That measurement is from the driver's side 
24 front tire of Darren Wilson's police car to the head 
25 of Michael Brown.

13 questions about the photographs or the diagram? 
14 Okay. 
15 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Last thing I have for 
16 this witness and this will probably be less than 
17 five minutes, unless Sheila can think of other 
18 questions. Detective, you took a crime scene video, 
19 you have already testified about that's one of the 
20 first things you did after your initial 
21 walk-through, then you do a video?

Yes, ma'am. 
We see you walking basically right around 
shields, body screens? 
Yes, ma'am. 
That you have put up? 
Correct. 
At that point in your investigation, had

1 clarification. You may or may not have covered it. 
2 Q (By Ms. Whirley) Your job is not to 
3 investigate the crime, is it? 
4 A No, just to collect, document, photograph 
5 the evidence. 
6 Q You don't talk to any lay witnesses and 
7 try to determine what happened or anything like 
8 that? 
9 A No, ma'am, information from witnesses is 
10 usually given to the crimes against persons 
11 detective that you will hear from later. Items of 
12 evidence that may come to light from their 
13 interviews is given to me from other detectives. I 
14 do not interview witnesses myself at any time. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: Thank you. You all have 
16 anything? 
17 I have a 
18 question about projectile. I know earlier you 
19 mentioned inside of the patrol car there was no 
20 casings?

1 him that he processed the vehicle at our crime lab. 
2 The one that was found, I 
3 think it was number 17, labeled 17. 
4 A Yes, sir. 
5 Is that one that entered 
6 the body and came out? 
7 A I can't testify to that. One of the 
8 ballistics firearms people that you might hear from, 
9 they can answer those questions, I cannot. 
10 
11 
Yes, ma'am. 
In the 
12 video I'm seeing, and your photographs, I'm seeing 
13 that there was shattered glass within the vehicle? 
14 A Yes. 
15 I'm only seeing two pieces 
16 sitting in the driver's seat of Officer Darren 
17 Wilson's vehicle. 
18 A Yes, ma'am. 
19 Was there any on the floor 
20 that you recall, I didn't really see any in the 
21 pictures as well? 
22 A I haven't looked at the other detectives'

10 A Chevy SUV. I'm not sure if it was a

12 All right, thanks. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Just real quickly. There 
14 was another part of your investigation you did 
15 another video from a perspective and that was 
16 because you were told somebody saw something from a 
17 particular window; is that correct? 
18 A Yes, ma'am, I did one and I know another 
19 detective that was at the scene did other ones. The 
20 one I did as far as where, I can't remember the 
21 address, it is on the evidence receipt, they had us 
22 go to different eyewitness perspectives just to 
23 stand there and video similar to this. There is not 
24 narration in it, it simply is a video, me standing, 
25 or whoever the camera operator was at the time,

1 standing where the witness states they were standing 
2 and observed whatever it was they observed. 
3 Again, there is not a narrative 
4 stating they saw this, they were seeing this and my 
5 particular video I know that I stood at the section 
6 where the witness stated she saw what was going on. 
7 I attempted to use our video camera to zoom in 
8 across the parking lot where she was saying she 
9 could see everything happening. 
10 My camera would only focus on the 
11 screen part of the door. It was through a sliding 
12 patio door, it would only focus on the screen no 
13 matter how much I would zoom in, it wouldn't show 
14 the scene from her perspective. I zoomed back, you 
15 had to step to the left and then zoomed in again to 
16 show the distance where she was seeing things and 
17 kind of give you a reference point because at the 
18 time when I did my witness perspective video, it was 
19 after we had picked everything up. 
20 It was the last thing, a witness had 
21 come forward at the very end and said hey, I think I 
22 saw this from here. The detective interviewed and 
23 asked to go down and shoot a witness perspective 
24 from her standpoint.

1 later, but I would rather show that to you in 
2 conjunction with that witness testimony so it will 
3 be easier for you to kind of tie those together, but 
4 from his perspective, you know his job, your job was 
5 then just to stand, whatever witness says where they 
6 were and film where she says what she saw she saw? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And the purpose of that 
9 is just to see could she see that, are there things 
10 in the way, was it such as that, correct? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Now, you said that from filming it, the 
13 camera would not focus beyond the screen? 
14 A The human eye could see through the screen 
15 and focus on a point farther than that. 
16 
17 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
The camera I was using at the time has 
18 focal limitations and would focus just on the 
19 screen. 
20 Q Let me ask you this, from your eyewitness 
21 perspective, could you see, not what she saw, could 
22 you see the place where she said she saw something? 
23 A From that specific perspective, she could 
24 only see where Michael Brown came to rest. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Okay. And so from whatever perspective

1 she was, she could not see farther west to where the 
2 officer's vehicle was? 
3 A No. 
4 Q Okay. But you are standing in her 
5 position, you could see where Michael Brown's body 
6 had been? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q How much farther west could you see beyond 
9 Michael Brown's body? 
10 A You could see from the angle she was at, 
11 which was to give you an orientation because I can 
12 see it in my head. She was on the northeast part of 
13 the apartment complex. 
Q Let's use your diagram. 14 
15 A Here it is. Her apartment building, if 
16 this is the entrance to Copper Creek Court, her 
17 apartment building is farther back this way, which 
18 would be the upper right-hand corner of the diagram. 
19 Again, this is not to scale, this 
20 building in particular comes from close to this 
21 driveway. Her perspective, and if I can come up 
22 here and use my finger to show, her perspective 
23 would have been on this line and the corner of the 
24 building would block the red stain where Michael 
25 Brown's body had been. You could just barely see

1 the stain in the road, the red stain in the road 
2 where his body had been. 
3 Q The large stain that was at his head? 
4 A Yes, that was still present. It was at an 
5 angle just like this, where this building would have 
6 come out at that angle and cut that part of the 
7 scene off where she couldn't see anything else. 
8 
9 
Q 
A 
10 address. 
11 Q 
Okay. Do you remember her name? 
I just wrote down her 
When that witness testifies, we will play 
12 that video for what it's worth given the focal 
13 limitations of the camera? 
14 Could she see to 
15 the east the full rest of the crime scene? 
16 
17 
A Yes, it was a third floor apartment. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody else? And as 
18 always, if there are questions later on of this 
19 officer and you would like to have him brought back, 
20 he will come back. 
21 All right. That concludes the testimony 
22 of Detective And that will conclude 
23 the evidence for today, September 3rd, of the grand 
24 jury investigation into the shooting of Michael 
25 Brown.
