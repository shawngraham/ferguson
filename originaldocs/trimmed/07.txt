GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME VII 
MS. WHIRLEY: Good morning. 
(Everybody says good morning.) 
MS. WHIRLEY: I'm Sheila Whirley. Of 
Page 5 
5 course, Kathi Alizadeh is here, 12 grand jurors is 
6 here, and the court reporter. Today is September 
7 the 25th, Thursday. And I don't have the total 
8 program memorized for this morning or for today. I 
9 can tell you our first witness is 
10 , we heard his taped 
11 statements last time we were here, recorded 
12 statements with the police, with the FBI agent, and 
13 also made several appearances on the media for CNN, 
14 and I think various TV channels. You guys remember 
15 that, he is going to testify live here this morning. 
16 And then, Kathi, could you tell us what 
17 else is on the agenda today? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: I don't know. No, 
19 actually, we have a witness scheduled for 10:30. He 
20 called me bright and early this morning to cancel, 
21 so we're going to probably play you, I don't think 
22 Witness Number 10, remember the guy that was 
23 He has a recorded statement 
24 I don't think I played. 
25 MS. WHIRLEY: Only played part of it. We

1 had about ten minutes left. 
2 MS. ALIZADEH: We can play the end of that 
3 to finish that and then we also have, you all heard 
4 from last time and she has media 
5 interviews that take, I think, about 33 minutes 
6 total for all of her media interviews. And then she 
7 also has some recorded statements that we can play 
8 and hopefully, that will fill out the morning. 
9 And then in the afternoon we have a 
10 witness scheduled to be here at 12:30. I will check 
11 and make sure he hasn't called to cancel during a 
12 break or whatever, hopefully then we will have 
13 another witness here in the afternoon. He also has 
14 a taped statement. I can't remember if it is 30 
15 minutes or an hour, it doesn't exceed an hour. 
16 So if he, you know, shows up, we can play 
17 his statement and then have him testify, and I think 
18 we are trying to recess 2:30. 
19 3:15. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: At the lunch break, if we 
21 need to figure out how to fill our time, we'll do 
22 that. 
23 Also, if you recall, Witness Number 10 had 
24 talked about the fact that he is,

3 I do have that clip and we will play it 
4 for you. It is only a couple minutes and, you know, 
5 just so you know, 
6 It is not a very long 
7 clip, so if you all, if we go through it, we can 
8 play it again. So we can go back and try to listen, 
9 because the person who is doing the recording 
10 occasionally speaks and, of course, their voice will 
11 kind of talk over the people that are in the 
12 background. 
13 So it might be, if you request it, it 
14 might be you want to hear that a couple of times 
15 just so you can try to pick up what's being said.

first witness.

1 months, so you know that it takes nine people to 
2 indict and the question was asked what if we have, 
3 what if we can't, since we're giving you a variety 
4 of different charges to consider, I think the 
5 question was, what if we don't have nine people that 
6 all agree on the same charge, what do we do then or 
7 what happens. 
8 And I wanted to make sure that I put that 
9 in there in the record that that was a question that 
10 was asked and we have had discussions about that and 
11 what I will tell you is we're researching this 
12 because we want to make sure before we tell you, you 
13 know, we want to make sure we're correct on the law, 
14 but I assure you that we will have an answer for you 
15 well before you begin your deliberations about what, 
16 in the event that that would happen, what happens 
17 then. All right.

1 window looking and, urn, my eyes, actually, I was 
2 still kind of focused, I was focused on both of 
3 them, but mainly on Dorian because he was still 
4 closer to the officer than Mike because Mike, he ran 
5 kind of fast at that time, but as I see Dorian 
6 ducking down looking at the officer shooting, I was 
7 kind of thinking that the officer was, he was going 
8 to stop, even hisself with the vehicle that his 
9 friend ran to and come over and shoot him.

11 
Q 
A 
Shoot Dorian?

11 going down, that he was going for a weapon in your 
12 opinion. 
13 A No, it just looked like he was going down 
14 because the moment I steps outside, I'm thinking now 
15 he's hit in his chest area and the officer lets out 
16 more shots. It looked like he was going down, 
17 anyway, not to like give up, like to surrender, but 
18 to go down and bleed, you know, because like I said, 
19 before even going down on his knees or whatever, the 
20 officer lets out more shots but he had his arms on 
21 his torso. 
22 Q When you say on his knees, what do you 
23 mean by that? 
24 A I'm just saying like before, like I said

2 hit the ground, like his knees didn't even hit the

6 Q Okay. And when he turned around, did you 
7 see him raise his hand in any way? I understand you

5 was it cocking back, is there any sort of smoke, 
6 shell casing, anything that you may have seen or 
7 heard during that? 
8 A No, no, he just, I say immediately, when 
9 they started running, he just gets out of his car 
10 and I see him in his shooting position and he lets 
11 out some rounds. So I didn't see no shells fall or 
12 no gun smoke or anything. 
13 As he is progressing, is 
14 he continually moving, what is he doing? 
15 A He's, he's, he's taking, he's taking like

17 anything, so he is just taking large steps, you 
18 know, towards him, you know, while his back is 
19 turned towards him.

A 
Q 
No, they didn't. 
And you know police took measurements of

6 where the officer was and where Mike Brown was if I 
7 show you that diagram?

Yeah. 
Okay. So I'm going to show you a diagram 
10 that was done, I'm not trying to mess you up at all 
11 because it is difficult to remember all of this, I 
12 get. So this is a diagram, Grand Jury Number 2, 
13 okay. 
14 And so this is where they measured 
15 where the police truck was when the police got 
16 there. You never saw that truck move again, did 
17 you?

You think it was closer up to here? 
Yeah, I know it was because there is a 
10 sign right here and it kind of evened itself up. I 
11 just know it was closer to the driveway right here. 
12 (indicating) 
13 Q So let me ask you this. Do you think that 
14 the police officer measured it wrong or do you think 
15 that the, anybody moved the truck? 
16 A No, no, I know that the truck was right 
17 here, it was definitely right here.

Q 
A 
Okay. 
Just before this driveway diagonally in

Q

You say the truck was more up here?

5 (All indicate yes.) 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: I can also put this up 
7 there. 
8 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So now here is in 
9 diagram the depiction of where Michael Brown's body 
10 came to rest, okay. And here is the little, the 
11 driveway or the street Caddiefield, and as you can 
12 see here, is Copper Creek Court up here to the 
13 north. 
14 So the way they have it, his body is 
15 somewhere right around here. You don't think that's 
16 right? 
17 A No, it is not right. His body is 
18 definitely right here because like I said, I live 
19 there and that's the driveway right here, his death 
20 bed is just a little bit past the driveway, just a 
21 little bit past the driveway. 
22 MS. ALIZADEH: You all want me to put this 
23 up here so he can point and follow along with yours?

1 your mind that's where you would see him because you 
2 are on a balcony, so that's the distance your eyes 
3 were focused where the two people are in position. 
4 And so you seen Mike collapse, I believe that from 
5 your balcony that's, that's where your eyes focused 
6 that that's where he laid, but actually like 
7 everything was done, they did the measurements, that 
8 it was a little bit further than your eyes focused 
9 on where he actually fell. So not saying that 
10 you're wrong, that's just from the vision point of 
11 your perspective that's where you were standing. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: And she's exactly right. 
13 I'm not trying to say you are lying about this or 
14 anything, I mean, don't make it, don't feel like 
15 you're on the defensive, like I'm trying to point 
16 out that you're wrong or that you weren't really 
17 there. 
18 
19 
A I was there. 
MS. ALIZADEH: I know you were there. But 
20 people remember things differently or they see 
21 things from a different perspective, distances are 
22 hard to judge. And so I just want to clear things 
23 up and I'm going to show you what is a photograph 
24 that was taken by the detective who processed the 
25 scene.

Q 
A 
You may be right. 
So you don't think that helps you?

15 on my balcony, that's why, I know it's a little wall 
16 right here, so from my balcony right here it is on 
17 the side. So I could barely see kind of because I 
18 got barbecue grills right here.

20

A

So I kind of leaned over and still see the

Okay. So you thought Dorian got in that 
2 front passenger seat? 
3 A Yes. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: I want to make sure we are 
5 clear on this. Are you just assuming that he got in 
6 the car because he was right there and then suddenly 
7 you didn't see him? 
8 A I seen him get inside, but as I said, I 
9 didn't see him like make a conversation with the 
10 person that was in. I know when I got to the 
11 ground, the car was gone. 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Right. You got to the 
13 ground after it was all over? 
A Yeah. 14 
15 MS. ALIZADEH: I guess my question is, 
16 that Monte Carlo is a two-door car? 
A Yes, as far as I remember. 17 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: I know it has been 
19 described before and I apologize if I don't know if

3 A Yeah. 
4 Did it to your, I guess, 
5 your opinion, did it ever seem like he was trying to 
6 tackle this officer? 
7 A No, huh-uh, no, not at all. It just 
8 looked like, the moment I come outside, I just 
9 thought he was hit, you know, in the stomach 
10 somewhere and he was going down, that's my vision 
11 right there. Oh, he's going down and then boom, 
12 boom, boom, he's down for sure. And, you know, I 
13 just knew he was dead the moment, I think, yeah, 
14 probably like the very last shot is when like I seen 
15 his face. 
16 Cause, urn, after all of them shots, I 
17 didn't see no blood like splatter until like his 
18 face hit the ground, so I thought his head busted up

21 clarify also, the time in which you were behind your

17 And that --and that he never entered 
18 their car or went up to that car that they killed 
19 him. He was yelling and he ran through the back 
20 fields of Canfield. 
21 DETECTIVE Okay. Did you notice 
22 anybody else outside? You made mention obviously of 
23 the, obviously, the the -- the guy with the

4 DETECTIVE All right. What, urn, 
5 what is your opinion of that incident itself? 
6 WITNESS 10: Initially, urn, I thought wow, 
7 urn, did he have to use the force on him. Urn, could 
8 he have taken and retrieved his taser, urn and tased 
9 the young guy. He was, I felt like he was unarmed 
10 and my initial thoughts was that. 
11 And after thinking about it and reviewing 
12 everything and putting myself in the police 
13 officer's shoes, I feel like he handled the 
14 situation correct force wise. The gunshot led from 
15 the car, the confrontation led from the car. 
16 He came out with his weapon drawn, urn, 
17 trying to pursue the suspect. 
18 Then, urn, at one point the suspect turns 
19 and if he, I felt he was really trying to give 
20 himself up, urn, the police officer already has his 
21 gun drawn. If you're really trying to give himself 
22 up, you're going to lay down on the ground and 
23 you're going to let it be known, urn, but that he 
24 didn't do that. 
25 And he charged at him and at that time I

4 everybody's point of view, I feel that, urn, most

1 video that was recorded by a cell phone. This video 
2 was obtained off of the internet. It is contained 
3 on Grand Jury Exhibit Number 26 that I've marked and 
4 might be better for me to do it, I know where to cue 
5 it up to. 
6 As I said, this is not very long and 
7 actually, this clip appears twice on this disc. One 
8 clip includes the video, which I will describe it, 
9 is after the shooting. 
10 The other clip of this contains just the 
11 audio and it has just a plain view screen and all 
12 you are hearing is the audio. It is the same clip, 
13 it is just without the video. I don't know if after 
14 you see the video on if it would assist you to then 
15 just do the audio to just kind of close your eyes 
16 and try to listen because as I said, it is difficult 
17 
18 
to hear because voices, that 
identified as own, is actually a background 
has 
19 speaker in this clip. Can I black that screen while 
20 I'm trying to find it or no? 
21 since this is not very long. It 
22 probably is okay for us to just record. Nobody says 
23 any identifying information on the recording. And 
24 also it would probably be difficult for you to even 
25 to attempt to transcribe it. We don't have a

1 transcript of this and I think one of the reasons, 
2 as you will see, it is very difficult to hear it, 
3 and I don't want to be in a position that I'm saying 
4 this is what we think is being said because it is 
5 your job to decide what you think is being said. 
6 And the entire clip is ten minutes long, 
7 however, I'm going to put the cursor forward to 
8 about a little past six minutes because that is the 
9 time when the conversation occurs that 
10 is talking. 
11 Again, this video in its entirety is ten 
12 minutes long. If you want to watch the entire 
13 video, you certainly can. 
14 I'm going to start the clip at exactly six 
15 minutes. 
16 (Clip is being played at this time.) 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, there again, the 
18 entire clip is ten minutes. If you want to watch 
19 the whole clip or if you want to watch a certain 
20 part of it again or if you want to just do the audio 
21 portion and listen, it is up to you. 
22 Let's just hear the audio. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: So you'd like to just hear 
24 the audio portion? You want me to start at six 
25 minutes or you want me to play the whole thing?

1 I think it would be okay 
2 if you start it at the exact same timeframe. 
3 (playing of the audio recording.) 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Start it at 5:59. You 
5 know, I'm not sure that that starts at the same 
6 place that I'm hearing this. Can I review this over 
7 the lunch hour and maybe we can, I don't want to 
8 represent to you that it starts at the same place 
9 because in my mind, I'm thinking it is not at the 
10 same place. 
11 So what's in the beginning 
12 of it, the rest of the six minutes? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: If you want to watch it, I 
14 mean, I don't want to necessarily characterize it 
15 except to say it is all after the shooting and that 
16 it appears to be someone who is recording with a 
17 cell phone or handheld device and then you hear 
18 people in the crowd talking, you hear people near 
19 the camera talking, I don't know if it is the person 
20 who is holding the camera that is doing all the 
21 talking. 
22 Okay. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: You can certainly watch the 
24 whole thing if you want. But before we listen to

5 the disc and try to do this at the lunch hour when I 
6 have time to look at it. 
7 Okay. The next thing we are going to play 
8 for you is a disc that is marked Grand Jury Number 
9 27, and it contains several clips which are media 
10 interviews that were done by , who 
11 you will recall testified yesterday, not yesterday, 
12 Tuesday. 
13 And we can go ahead, there is 33 minutes 
14 of video clips. I might speak during and in between 
15 them. Leave the recorder on.

20 on CNN Tonight.

8 Did anybody want to see any of these clips

3 So could you just tell us in your own 
4 words and from the beginning what happened that 
5 Saturday, August the 9th. 
6 Okay. As I was coming 
7 around the curve, I hear like tires squeaking, like 
8 "urrrr". And as I get up on the truck, I see them 
9 wrestling through the window. I tried to pull my 
10 phone out because it just didn't look normal for 
11 someone to be wrestling through a cop's window. 
12 So I saw them like pulling back and forth, 
13 like he was trying to pull out, the cop is pulling 
14 in. And when I tried to pull my phone out, the shot 
15 came out, so I like went to the left to try to get 
16 out of the way. 
17 As I'm going to the left, I see the kid, 
18 there ain't no way and that's when he takes off 
19 running. 
20 The cop follows him, shooting behind him, 
21 the kid's body jerks as if he was hit, he turns 
22 around and puts his hands up and the cop continued 
23 to fire until he goes down. 
24 Okay. Where were you coming 
25 around the corner, does this look familiar?

5 Okay. Can you describe, did

7 I didn't, I couldn't see. 
8 I didn't see blood until when he laid there and 
9 started pouring from him. It didn't register to me 
10 that he was dead until I saw the blood. I didn't 
11 see any of that. 
12 As he was turning around, did 
13 he put his hands anywhere on himself? 
14 No. 
15 No? 
16 No. 
17 Did you notice anything about 
18 his hands or his arms?

23 fell to the ground. 
24 So you are saying, I wanted to

8 No. 
9 No, okay. 
10 So when he jerked that's 
11 when like whenever, that's what happened where his 
12 hands were at. I can't say where his hands was 
13 until I saw his jerk and that, that is when I saw 
14 like come up. It was involuntary because it was 
15 just like a reaction to a jerk. That is whenever he 
16 turned around and put his hands up like that. 
17 You show with his palms up, 
18 were you able to see his two palms?

17 When you asked me were they 
18 pulling, was it a tug of war or did you see the 
19 officer's hands. No, I didn't see the officer's 
20 hands, but you can tell when somebody is being 
21 pulled. 
22 Okay, that's fair. So you are

So, uh, and then I end up looking out the 
3 back window, I guess, coming down the way or 
4 whatnot. Like the whole time I don't know, I 
5 blanked out or whatnot because I'm not hearing 
6 anything, but I didn't hear nothing from the time 
7 that they was at the truck. We are both, from the 
8 officer's truck to the time he was running and 
9 whatnot because I guess he had got down the street 
10 some, a little after him or whatnot.

19 view mirror. So I guess they got down the street, 
20 you know, got down towards, they still in the yellow 
21 line the whole time. So get down, get down a way 
22 and Mike Brown kind of swayed and turned around. 
23 His hands weren't fully up, he kind of turned around 
24 and he was just like that, and then he slid off 
25 three more shots and fell on his face. (indicating)

I basically saw him kind of, you know,

4 Michael Brown did? 
5 A Yeah. 
6 At what point did Dorian 
7 leave?

13 going on between the two men or the police officer,

15 stop.

5 moving, Michael Brown was a tall man, could you see 
6 his head over top of the Tahoe or was it --

22 and then went to the car and then stepped back again 
23 and went to the car? 
24 A Like, I mean, I guess you can kind of say,

7 was probably like what, five or six seconds, that's 
8 when end up seeing him running past her door. 
9 To clarify, 
10 five or six seconds past after the shot before you

3 In speaking with her, is 
4 it that she might be concerned about the safety, her 
5 safety and the safety of her children is why maybe 
6 she's not coming forward at this point? 
7 A It might be because it is just, thing with 
8 her too, she is just trying to get away from there 
9 because there is just too much going on. 
10 Too much going on? 
11 A Yeah. I mean, we talked about it, you 
12 know, she said before she wanted to, but I don't 
13 know how she really feels about it now. 
14 I'm sorry, is there a lot 
15 of conversation in the air, that okay you know, if 
16 you say something, something might happen to you or

1 Sorry, one more. Again, 
2 you said you were sitting in the car, you heard the 
3 first gunshot, and can you explain again the second 
4 shot you heard fired was when, what was happening 
5 when that second shot was fired? 
6 A Oh, okay. When the first shot happened, I 
7 told to roll back, open the doors, you know, 
8 kind of take for cover, you know, for a thought. So 
9 we basically stopped, so Mike Brown came on her 
10 side, you know, scooting off or whatnot. I heard a 
11 second shot from then. I didn't see the officer or 
12 none of that. 
13 I don't know if he was in the car or 
14 he might have open his door slightly and shot, I 
15 don't know because the car is catty-corner. I 
16 couldn't see through the tint. I didn't basically 
17 see the scuffle or nothing, I just saw his feet.

25 the car, but opened the doors.

Go back 
3 to the second shot. Did it appear to you that 
4 Michael Brown was running when he heard the second 
5 shot? 
6 
7 
A He was basically, he was basically past 
door. I don't know if he might have been 
8 back by the wheel or just passing her back end, but 
9 I just wasn't looking at all directly. 
10 I was basically looking like walking 
11 past, heard a second shot, it is kind of ducking. 
12 We didn't know where it went or where it was coming 
13 or whatnot, yeah. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: He was traveling away from 
15 the officer when you heard the second shot? 
16 A Yeah, yeah. 
17 How far apart 
18 were your car and the police officer's car? 
19 
20 
A Urn --
MS. ALIZADEH: There is two different 
21 distances because they back up. 
22 Good point. Initially 
23 before, you back up, how far apart are your two 
24 cars? 
25 A Urn, basically feel like, it wasn't bumper

1 to bumper, but say might have been 3 or 4 feet, 
2 enough to see up under a SUV, you know. 
3 And then when you guys 
4 backed up, be able to back up, how far back did you 
5 back up? 
6 A Yeah, probably like 8 feet by then, 7 
7 feet. 
8 Okay. 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, you brought up another 
10 point that I want to ask about. You said you can 
11 see underneath the car, and I know it is an SUV and 
12 sits up higher, but don't you think, if you were 3 
13 or 5 feet. 
14 A See, I'm the passenger, the car is 
15 catty-corner, I can see straight up under there, 
16 right up under there. She couldn't see it from her 
17 side, she couldn't see like there, right at the feet 
18 like I could. I could see, you know, just from 
19 looking right up under the SUV. 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: You were looking through 
21 the windshield, front windshield when you could see 
22 underneath the car. 
23 A You couldn't see through the back 
24 windshield, it was tinted.

2 A Yes. 
3 I just 
4 want to make sure I understand what both of those 
5 people are trying to get to. When you were looking 
6 through the windshield and under the car, you are 
7 maybe a foot from the police cruiser? 
8 A Yeah, like I say. 
9 It wasn't until you 
10 backed up that you were about 5 feet from them? 
11 A Yeah. 
12 Then you have a better 
13 view of things but then by that time you were 
14 trying 
15 A I mean, like from the get-go, from the 
16 get-go from when he pulled back, I can still, I can 
17 see from under that truck the movement. 
18 You can still see, the 
19 reason you can only see under the truck was because

2 MS. ALIZADEH: I just wanted to add that 
3 during the playing of the interview, I had marked a 
4 map as Grand Jury Exhibit Number 28. And originally 
5 I put it up on the screen, but we couldn't do that 
6 while it was playing so that kind of went around and 
7 I wanted just to make a record that the map that 
8 drew on or was used during his
