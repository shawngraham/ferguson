GRAND JURY HEARING VOLUME XXI 
MS. ALIZADEH: Good morning. It is 
1 
2 
3 Monday, November lOth. It is about 9:30 in the 
4 morning. This is Kathi Alizadeh, Sheila Whirley is 
5 here and all 12 grand jurors are here, as well as 
6 , the court reporter. 
7 We started this morning with a 
8 conversation that was not on the record, but someone 
9 from the prosecutor's office has talked to the grand 
10 jurors about their concerns for security, safety and 
11 giving you some tips on how to be secure and safe 
12 from here on out. 
13 I will stress again it is my 100, 
14 110 percent sure that your identities will never be 
15 released by this office or by the courts. I'm aware 
16 that some of you are concerned that, you know, your 
17 identities might be discovered by people in the 
18 media or others, you know. We're doing our best 
19 that you are safe and secure after your service here 
20 no matter what your decision. And so that took up a 
21 little bit of time this morning. 
22 
23 
So we are getting started this morning.

24 Police Department, and he is in charge of their

1 I will tell you that last week we had 
2 quite a bit of conversation, not conversation, 
3 testimony and evidence regarding radio 
4 communications, and regarding the county RIOT A 
5 channel. 
6 I will tell you that after our last 
7 meeting, I think we met last Thursday was when we 
8 were last here, I have discovered that channel three 
9 is not the RIOT A channel in Ferguson. 
10 So working under that assumption that it 
11 was, and there was some talk about having a map and 
12 so forth. 
13 You remember who was here 
14 and testified, he's with county communications. He 
15 did a map for me that has the location of all of the 
16 county's voting receivers, you remember those ones 
17 that pick up the RIOT A channel. 
18 There's also on the map where the Ferguson 
19 receiver is in relation to where the officer was, so 
20 I will hand out these maps. 
21 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 85 
22 marked for identification.) 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: I've marked my copy as 
24 Grand Jury Number 85. Mine is not in color. 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
There's a legend on this map that says

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury, Volume XXI November 13, 2014 
Page 7 
1 that incident. Okay. So he describes on the map 
2 incident and that would be what happened on 
3 Canfield. The location of where the incident 
4 occurred, okay. 
5 And if you will look on the map, there's 
6 actually a little police car and that's on the map, 
7 that's him marking where the incident occurred on 
8 Canfield. 
9 So in this legend it says, incident to 
10 Ferguson received, the main receiver at Ferguson 
11 Police Department is 1.57 miles from the place of 
12 the incident to the receiver. 
13 So I'll pass those around. But my 
14 understanding now is that the RIOT A channel might 
15 not be relevant to our, to what you guys are looking 
16 at. Maybe it was informative, but we are going to 
17 have Sergeant talk about the Ferguson 
18 communications and how that works and what exactly, 
19 what channel is what and so forth, okay. So I will 
20 go get him and get started.

4 A I'm the supervisor for communications. 
5 Q And so do you then, you're not a 
6 supervisor of a squad of police officers? 
7 A No, ma'am. The only time I do that is 
8 when a supervisor goes on vacation and I will be a 
9 substitute until they get back. 
10 Q So when you're talking about being in 
11 charge of communications, that would be 911 calls? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So Ferguson receives and dispatches their 
14 own 911 calls, correct?

21 that as well? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so we've heard a bit of testimony

So how many dispatchers work a shift? 
I try to get at least two in there, 
13 sometimes there's three. 
14 Q Does each dispatcher have their own 
15 console? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. 
17 Q And so when calls are coming in, can 
18 either dispatcher, if there is two working, can 
19 either dispatcher answer the call?

1 Q And you are wearing your own portable 
2 radio, correct? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q And so do all the radios in Ferguson, the 
5 portables, are they all the same, do they all look 
6 the same? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q So the radio that you bought with you 
9 today, whose radio is that?

A 
Q 
12 radio? 
13 A

That's Darren Wilson's. 
Is each officer assigned his own portable 
Yes, they are. 
So do they generally then take it home 
15 with them at the end of their shift? 
16 A They can take it home, they can do what 
17 they want with it. It is theirs. 
18 
19 
20 
Q So it doesn't go to another officer? 
A No, ma'am. 
Q And then, obviously, well, not obvious, 
21 well, let's talk about the cars. So the radio 
22 itself is mounted in a police car, that doesn't get 
23 removed, correct? 
24 A Yes, ma'am. 
25 Q That's the mobile?

A 
Q 
Page 13 
Yes. 
And so does each officer have his own car 
3 to take home? 
4 A No, ma'am. The only ones that have their 
5 own cars are resident officers that live in town 
6 that have their own car. The only thing they don't 
7 have in those resident cars are computers. 
8 Everything else is set up the same. 
9 Q So we've seen pictures and heard testimony 
10 about Officer Wilson's car, that it was a Chevy 
11 Tahoe? 
12 
13 
14 that? 
15 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
Are all the Ferguson police vehicles like 
No, ma'am. We have one Chevy detective 
16 car, it's an Impala. And then we also have Crown 
17 Vies that are weeding out of the system. 
18 
19 
20 
Q 
A 
Q 
So the Tahoes are newer? 
Yes, they are. 
And so Officer Wilson's car had a mobile 
21 radio and then it also had a computer in it; is that 
22 right? 
23 A Yes, it is. 
24 Q And you said that the resident officer, 
25 people who live in the city limits get to take a car

Page 14 
Yes, ma'am. 
But they don't have computers? 
No. 
Was Darren Wilson a resident officer? 
No, ma'am. 
7 Q So when you are done with your shift as an 
8 officer, if you're not a resident officer, you take 
9 your car back to the station and then get your 
10 personal car and go home? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then is that vehicle put back in 
13 service like on the next shift? 
14 A Yes, it is. 
15 Q Okay. Urn, so each car has a number; is 
16 that right? 
17 A Yes, ma'am. 
18 Q And so when a radio in a car calls out, 
19 can the dispatcher tell by the signal which car it 
20 is? 
21 A No, ma'am. The only time you can tell 
22 which vehicle it is if the alert tone is sounded, 
23 that's the emergency alert tone. It will come up 
24 with what they call an alias on the screen and that 
25 will tell which vehicle it is so that dispatcher is

1 aware. 
2 Q And so we already heard some testimony 
3 about the alert tone, and that's the orange button 
4 that's on the mobile, the portable; is that right? 
A Yes, ma'am, it is this button. 5 
6 Q There's an orange alert button also on the 
7 mobile radio inside the car, correct? 
A Yes, there is. 8 
9 Q And so if an officer activates that alert 
10 button, can the dispatcher tell what radio it is by 
11 his car 108? 
12 A Yes, ma'am. 
13 Q And, obviously, each officer has their own 
14 radio, they would know whose radio it is? 
15 A Yes. 
16 Q If it is a portable? 
17 A Yes. It comes up on a screen with their 
18 name and also the radio number. 
19 Q Okay. And then you also told me that it 
20 would say M, for mobile or P, is there P for 
21 portable? 
22 A That's on the new system for the cars. If 
23 the cars, the alias will come up with the last 
24 letter M is for mobile. When we switch over to the 
25 new radio system, that will still be with a P for

1 portable, but we do not have that yet. 
2 Q We heard some talk about the County 
3 installing or putting in place this new 800 
4 megahertz radio communication system; is that right? 
A Yes, ma'am. 5 
6 Q But you are not apart of that yet? 
7 A Not yet. 
8 Q So the radio system that you are using 
9 today, is that the same radio system that was in 
10 place on August 9th? 
A Yes, ma'am. 11 
12 Q So everything that we're talking about so 
13 far was the way it was on August 9th? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. 
15 Q And so if an officer hits that alert tone, 
16 we have already heard what happens then, but the 
17 dispatcher is able to tell at least whether it is a 
18 mobile radio or a portable radio? 
A Yes, ma'am. 19 
20 Q And then the dispatcher would know by the 
21 radio number whose portable it was? 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And they also know if it is a mobile 
24 radio, what car it's in? 
25 A Right.

Page 17 
All right. And so the radio that you 
2 brought with you, you said is Darren Wilson's radio, 
3 correct? 
4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q And you took the back off of it to show me 
6 something earlier today? 
7 A Yes, it is the radio. Each radio comes 
8 with a number, either their DSN is on there or their 
9 name is the put on the radio itself. And it 
10 coincides with the inventory list that is made up 
11 when the radio is passed out. 
12 Q And so you just took the back off of that 
13 portable radio and what's written on the inside of 
14 it? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
17 his DSN? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
D. Wilson, radio 99. 
And so is 99 the radio number or is that 
That is the radio number. 
Okay. And so if ever, I mean, all the 
20 radios look alike. If ever two radios would get 
21 mixed up, you would be able to open that up, anybody 
22 could open it up and see whose it is? 
23 A Yes, ma'am. We can also look at the 
24 serial number also on there and determine whose it 
25 is.

(Grand jury Exhibit Number 90 
marked for identification.) 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) I'm going to hand you 
4 what I marked as Grand Jury Exhibit 90. You brought 
5 with you today some paperwork about the 
6 communication system and who is assigned to what 
7 radio and so forth; is that right? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
I am going to show you Grand Jury Exhibit 
10 Number 90. It says portable radio inventory. Did 
11 you print that off and bring it with you this 
12 morning? 
13 A Yes, I did. 
14 Q What does this show? 
15 A This is telling me who has the radio, 
16 model number of the radio, the number of the radio 
17 and also the serial number of the radio. 
18 It also tells me if it has a mike 
19 attached to it. 
20 
21 
Q 
A 
Okay. 
Whose the patrol detectives, or the jail, 
22 who has the radio. 
23 Q Okay. So now in the column that says 
24 assignment vehicle, personnel, spare, cash, et 
25 cetera, it has officer's DSN as opposed to their

3 
4 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
What 
609. 
So on 
is Officer Wilson's DSN? 
this record then we can see that DSN 5 
6 609 has radio HT750 and then in the corner it says 
7 9 9, who wrote that? 
A I wrote that. 8 
9 
10 
Q Did you write that prior to coming today? 
A No, a lot of these when we were doing 
11 inventories, either the officer was off that day or 
12 they were on vacation. And I, as you can see there, 
13 is like unknown what their numbers are. 
14 So when they come back on duty, then 
15 I can get with them and find out what their number 
16 is and I will write it in. 
17 Q Okay. I'm going to pass copies of this 
18 around to everybody. 
19 And so not only can you tell that 
20 that's Officer Wilson's radio by looking in the 
21 back, but also you can double check with the 
22 inventory that you have to make sure that the serial 
23 number on that radio is the same as the radio 
24 assigned to him, correct?

1 Q Okay. And so again, when a radio, when 
2 somebody on a portable radio calls in to dispatch, 
3 is there anything on a screen that tells that 
4 dispatcher who it is? 
5 
6 
A 
Q 
No, ma'am. 
And so how is it that officers then will 
7 typically identify themselves when they are calling 
8 in? 
9 A They have sectors. And that's determined 
10 when they come in in the morning and they are doing 
11 the roll call, the supervisor will give them a 
12 sector. That sector number, which will be like 
13 maybe F22, F23, that's their sector number, that's 
14 their call sign for dispatch. 
15 Q Is that permanently their sector number or 
16 does it change on a regular basis? 
17 A It changes on a regular basis. They do 
18 what they call a rotation of sector. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. So is a sector a geographic area? 
Yes, it is. 
How many sectors are there in Ferguson? 
There's four. 
So at any given time, how many officers 
24 are on assignment in a sector? 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
One officer will take care of their

1 sector. And then usually if the squad has a full 
2 amount of officers, they will have what they call 
3 cover cars. Those cover cars will assist the 
4 sectors on any calls. 
5 So if you have a sector car, say F25 
6 goes out on a call, a sick case and he's tied up on 
7 that sick case, dispatch will know that. She will 
8 send a cover car to take another call in his sector. 
9 Q So each sector has one officer that is 
10 assigned to it for that shift? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then how many cover cars are out on 
13 any given shift? 
14 A It can range from maybe one to three, and 
15 I've even seen four, depending on how many people 
16 are working that day. 
17 Q So the cover car is kind of roaming around 
18 the city and can go anywhere whereas the sector car 
19 is going to stay in their own sector? 
A Yes, ma'am. 20 
21 Q Unless they have to leave their sector for 
22 whatever reason? 
23 A Right. 
24 Q And then on any given shift, there's a 
25 supervisor on duty, correct?

5 Q 
Page 22 
Yes, there is. 
How many supervisors? 
There is usually two lieutenants and a 
Okay. So the sergeant would be directly 
6 in charge of the officers that are riding around in 
7 their sector and the cover cars? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then is that sergeant generally also 
10 in uniform in a patrol car patrolling the city? 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
And then what's the lieutenant doing? 
He's usually in the station doing 
14 paperwork, doing the reports. When he usually gets 
15 called, caught up with the paperwork he'll come out 
16 on patrol also to assist. 
17 Q So on any given shift there's just one 
18 shift working, so there would be one sergeant and 
19 four sector cars and maybe one to three cover cars? 
20 A Yes, ma'am. 
21 When an 
22 officer, when a sector car is out on duty and he 
23 takes a call. 
24 A Uh-huh.

1 calls in and let you know, I'm in position to take 
2 this matter, this issue, blah, blah, blah. Does the 
3 cover car gets called in to let him know, okay, I 
4 need the cover car to service the area or how it 
5 works? 
6 A I know what you are saying. 
7 Okay. 
8 A Usually it works like this. If I call a 
9 car to a sector and that car is out on a sick case, 
10 the cover car automatically hears that they kind of 
11 move over to that area. 
12 Okay. 
13 A They are not actually told to cover it, 
14 but just in experience, they will move to that area 
15 knowing that something could break out in there so 
16 they have coverage. So it is mainly the officer, it 
17 takes the experience of the officer to hear that and 
18 he'll move over into that area. 
19 The cover car should be 
20 able to hear? 
21 
22 
23 
A 
A 
Oh, yeah. 
Okay. I lost my thought. 
Sometimes you'll hear a supervisor get on 
24 the radio and say Frank 28 centralized. That means 
25 they want him to move in closer to his area to cover

1 it. 
2 Okay. You answered it, 
3 okay, thanks. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So when an officer is on 
5 duty and patrolling, is he by himself in his 
6 vehicle? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 Q And currently you have two officers 
9 patrolling together; is that right? 
A Yes. 10 
11 Q And that's because of the unrest that has 
12 happened since August 9th? 
13 Yes, ma'am. 
14 Prior to August 9th you would have one man 
15 
16 Yes, ma'am. 
17 And so if the officers are out on patrol, 
18 people already testify that in the mobile 
19 can have like one channel tuned in and you 
20 can have a different channel tuned in on your 
21 portable. Are the officers to be monitoring the 
22 dispatch channel at all times? 
23 A They do. You've got to remember the 
24 mobile units have what they call a scan portion in 
25 it and dispatch is put in on a priority button. So

Page 25 
1 even if you are on scan and say RIOT A comes up on 
2 your radio and they're listening to the RIOT 
3 channel. As soon as dispatch hits their key in 
4 dispatch, it will cut them off and put them in 
5 priority. So they're constantly monitoring that 
6 dispatch channel. 
7 Q So the dispatcher at the station, she's on 
8 a transmitter, he or she is on a transmitter. Do 
9 you know how many watts that transmitter is? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
No, I don't. 
Can anybody in the city typically hear the 
12 transmission from the dispatcher? 
13 A They can. Sometimes you do miss calls. 
14 Q And so, you know, we talked earlier about 
15 this say, for example, an officer is going to go on 
16 a sick call, we've talked about, that would be 
17 something that is like short of breath or there has 
18 been somebody faint or something, so the officer is 
19 going to go to a residence and they're going to walk 
20 up to the house. So they leave their mobile car, 
21 the mobile radio in their car and now they're on 
22 their walkie-talkie or their portable, right? 
23 A Yes, ma'am. 
24 Q And so you've told me that it is not 
25 unusual, or even it might be typical that the

Page 26 
1 officer once he makes contact or goes into the 
2 residence, might even turn down the volume on his 
3 radio and why is that? 
4 A That's to, when an officer goes into a 
5 sick case, we have a lot of elderly folks, they are 
6 hard to hear. An officer will walk up and just turn 
7 the radio down a portion just so they can hear. You 
8 can hear it through the mike, you don't hear it 
9 through the receiver itself, you hear it through the 
10 mike so it is pretty close. Even when it's down you 
11 can hear it. 
12 They want to have all of their 
13 attention on that person or patient and not listen 
14 to a bunch of garble. 
15 Q Okay. So is it also possible that if 
16 you're on your portable radio and say you go into a 
17 building or whatever, that your radio might not 
18 actually receive a call because of you being inside 
19 a building? 
20 A Right. We have a lot of problems in what 
21 we call one sector where Wal-Mart and Sam's. 
22 Because of the metal building, our walkies won't get 
23 out. A lot of time they can hear at dispatch, but 
24 officers can't call out. 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
And if an officer is on the dispatch

314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com 
State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson 
Grand Jury, Volume XXI November 13, 2014 
Page 27 
1 channel and calls out, if that call is not heard by 
2 dispatch, how does the officer know that? 
3 A Say it again? 
4 Q If the officer calls out on the dispatch 
5 channel. 
6 A Okay. 
7 Q And let's say that the dispatch doesn't 
8 get that call, they don't hear it or they can't make 
9 it out? 
10 
11 
12 that? 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
Uh-huh. 
How does the officer, how might you know 
Dispatch would constantly try to get in 
14 contact with the officer. All dispatchers have 
15 their cell phone numbers for officers. They have a 
16 paper in front of them. It is in a book. If they 
17 can't get ahold of an officer, a lot of time, say 
18 they pick up shoplifter at Wal-Mart, they will 
19 attempt to call that officer several times. And if 
20 they can't get him, they realize they are in a metal 
21 building. So they'll right away get either on their 
22 cell phone or they will call Wal-Mart store to get 
23 ahold of them. 
24 Q So if an officer actually calls, makes a 
25 call on his mike.

A Okay. 1 
2 Q And that doesn't get received, there's no 
3 tone or anything that tells him it wasn't received, 
4 correct? 
5 A No, no. 
6 Q And so are there times then when the 
7 officer, so when an officer makes a call into 
8 dispatch and he may or may not use his call signal 
9 for that day, correct? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And so he may call in Frank 21 and then 
12 dispatch will say Frank 21 repeat, to let him know I

Q 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. And in your experience as an 
patrolling the streets of Ferguson, is 
for an officer to transmit a call from 
radio that dispatch does not get? 
No. 
And why would that be? 
It could be a lot of circumstances. 
15 could be the terrain, it could be any number of 
16 things where the officer is at if he's in a 
it 
his 
It 
17 building, depending on if he's in concrete, if he's 
18 in a basement.

4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q What about the area of Canfield Green 
6 Apartment Complex, is that a dead zone? 
7 A That could be considered a dead zone.

9 transmissions from a portable from that dead zone 
10 area?

Q 
Yes. 
And you and I and one of your dispatchers 
13 actually sat and listened to a lot of calls this 
14 morning; is that right?

16 Q And we're going to hear those calls, but 
17 are there times when a call might just be static? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And that might be somebody calling in for 
20 some reason, the signal strength does not allow him 
21 to be heard?

Q

And are there times when there are calls

1 Q Would that also be, again, possibly their 
2 signal is weak or there might be some building in 
3 between that transmitter and the receiver? 
4 A That could be a number of things. That 
5 could be either the signal is weak, could be that 
6 somebody is walking on them, meaning somebody is 
7 trying to call in at the same time they're talking. 
8 Q Okay. And when that happens, is it the 
9 stronger signal that walks on top of the other call? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
12 first? 
13 A 
14 Q 
Yes, it is. 
It doesn't matter who keys their mike up 
No. 
If somebody keys their mike up and starts 
15 talking and the stronger signal keeps their mike up, 
16 the person who is weaker will cut out? 
17 A Correct. Usually that happens when an 
18 officer's in a vehicle with a higher range of power 
19 and it will cut the walkie. 
20 Q Okay. And so the walkies or the portables 
21 being the weaker signal, you would find that that 
22 would be something that would occur most often with 
23 a portable?

1 Q All right. And so is channel three a 
2 receive only channel? 
3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q So an officer whose walkie-talkie is on 
5 channel three, he can hear somebody transmitting on 
6 that channel, but he can't transmit on that channel? 
7 A No, ma'am. 
8 Q How about dispatch, if dispatch is on 
9 channel three, can they transmit on that channel?

11 
A 
Q 
Yes, they can. 
Can they also hear what is being received 
12 on that channel? 
13 A Yes, ma'am. 
14 Q And then so we also talked earlier today 
15 about when an officer's radio is on channel three, 
16 and you demonstrated for me if an officer has his 
17 radio tuned to a receive only channel, does he get a 
18 tone on that radio? 
19 
20 
21 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes, he does. 
And what's the purpose of that? 
Telling that person that you need to get 
22 on a transmission station, you're on a receive only. 
23 Q So does that tone play when you switch to 
24 that channel or does it only play if you key up the 
25 mike?

1 A The only time it plays a tone if you 
2 switch to the channel as if that's just a dead 
3 channel completely. If it isn't, you can switch it 
4 to that channel, but as soon as you key up on it, it 
5 will make the same tone. 
6 Q So like you don't have channel 12 in 
7 Ferguson, correct? 
8 A No, ma'am.

10 you're going to hear a tone? 
11 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
A 
As soon as you switch to it. 
That tone comes out of the mike? 
It actually comes out of both the receive 
14 and the mike. 
15 Q So if it is not a dead channel, so it is 
16 like channel three, a receive only channel, you have 
17 to actually key up the mike to hear that tone?

You get the chirp turning the radio on. 
Okay. 
This is channel three, it is dead, it is 
(indicating) That's what the officer would

Right. 
All right. So let's see. I think I've

A 
Yes, ma'am. 
What does CAD stand for? 
That's Computed Aided Dispatch. 
What is CAD, what is the CAD system? 
That's when we have calls, we have a ITI 
19 system it is called. And what they do, the call 
20 will come out, dispatchers use that for the 
21 reporting. The officer can write in there what they 
22 did. There is a report that doesn't need to be 
23 taken, an official report, they can put, it is like 
24 a little entry in there for notes. What he did when 
25 he was on the call, that way that's always in there.

Uh-huh. 
And then she would have to separately

13 this call? 
14 A 
15 Q 
Yes. 
So she puts some kind of notes related to

And then that information, that CAD

17 computers in their cars? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, it does. 
And then the officers can also enter 
20 things in the CAD system, correct?

And if the officer does, does the

Q 
They can't change somebody else's entry? 
No, ma'am. 
How about dispatch, can she change it? 
No, ma'am. Only a supervisor can do that. 
Now, let's talk about internal clock. We 8 
9 talked about this you and I. So when a call is 
10 received by an officer into dispatch, there's a 
11 clock in dispatch that the dispatchers use, correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And it is physically a digital clock that 
14 sits there, correct? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And is that clock the accurate time? 
Yes, ma'am. 
I don't even know what the accurate, there 
19 is some kind atomic, I was going to say nuclear. 
20 Some type atomic clock in some mountain state some 
21 place, so that clock is the exact time, correct? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So sometimes when the dispatcher 
24 responding, or involved in a call she will actually 
25 call out the time 11:36?

A 
Q 
Page 43 
Yes, ma'am. 
She's getting that from her clock? 
Yes. 
Now, when a dispatch call comes in and 
5 might be answered by the dispatcher, does the 
6 computer give that call a date and time? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And is that the same time that might be on 
9 the call clock that the dispatcher is looking at? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes, it is. 
Is it ever off, have you had occasions to 
12 see that those two times are not the same? 
13 A Sometimes they do get unsynchronized. The 
14 main problem we have is the 911 system, it is not 
15 synchronized. 
16 Q So let's talk about the 911 system. I 
17 think you already said Ferguson does their own 911

Yes. 
Those calls also have a date and time

7 the past? 
8

A 
Q 
Yes. 
And how many minutes have they been off in 
I've seen it as much as 21 minutes off. 
Okay. So if you are, would it be fair to 
10 say then that if you're going to look back at your 
11 911 calls and the record of the calls, the time 
12 that's listed for those calls on the computer are 
13 not necessarily accurate? 
14 A Right. 
15 Q Okay. And you also said that it might be 
16 that the actual dispatch call radio traffic, that 
17 might be not in sync with the actual clock that the 
18 dispatcher is looking at?

3 A Yes, ma'am. 
4 Q Now, you testified that each officer has a 
5 call number assigned to him? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q And depending on the day or the shift that

15 a transcript and the officers are identified by 
16 their number like 21, 22, 24, okay. 
17 So you and I and your dispatcher sat

19 actually made some changes on the transcript as you 
20 would be telling me oh, that's so and so.

2 We do also do radio checks every 
3 Sunday on the midnight shift for alert tone test to 
4 make sure that the alert tone is still working. 
5 We also do that with cars too, so 
6 that's all done on a Sunday evening when they're 
7 somewhat quiet. 
8 Each officer that's working will have 
9 to hit their alert tone so we know that walkie is 
10 working then. If it isn't, we know to take it out 
11 and get them another walkie and get it repaired. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: So they do that on a weekly 
13 basis? 
14 A Yes, ma'am, it's every Sunday night on the

19 It 
20 doesn't matter what radio frequency that you are on

7 and the walkie number. 
8 MS. WHIRLEY: When that button is hit, 
9 what is the dispatcher, what is she supposed to do 
10 or he? 
11 A They ask right away, everything else quits 
12 all the traffic dies down. She gets on there and 
13 asks, you know, who the walkie is, are you okay. 
14 Everything 10-4 and then he's supposed to respond 
15 back. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: And if he doesn't? 
17 A If he doesn't, then they start doing a 
18 roll call finding out where everybody is at.

1 County maybe has something big going on, so they'll 
2 get on that channel. 
3 MS. WHIRLEY: Just to hear what's going on 
4 because they are not responding to the calls 
5 generally? 
6 A No, huh-uh. But that's put into a scan 
7 mode so the officer doesn't actually physically 
8 switch to that channel. It is automatically 
9 scanning that channel. So if there's a transmission 
10 on that channel it will come up. But if dispatch 
11 wants to get ahold of them, it will supersede that 
12 channel and take over. 
13 So it is on a priority button. 
14 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. So if you are 
15 scanning the County's RIOT channel, that's not going 
16 to interfere with your dispatcher communicating with 
17 you or you communicating with your dispatcher?

1 of dead zone, or could be. I wasn't sure what that 
2 meant. 
3 A Some walkies have a problem with it. You 
4 have got to remember Canfield used to be a golf 
5 course, a lot of hills and a lot of terrain, 
6 different terrain in there. 
7 If you're standing a certain way, 
8 that walkie will not get out. Then if you just move 
9 2 feet over, you have got transmission. It is just 
10 a weird, the way the terrain is. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. Do you have your 
12 officers complaining who work in Canfield Green, 
13 hey, I'm not getting my calls or I can't send you my 
14 location. 
15 A Yes. We have a few. It mainly happens in 
16 one sector, not in four sector.

1 we have what they call a Dellwood repeater, it is 
2 right there by the Dellwood Civic Center. It is on 
3 a separate tower. If that isn't working correctly, 
4 you will have problems getting out in one sector. 
5 We go all the way to Old Halls Ferry and 270. If 
6 you're on a walkie-talkie on an accident, you won't 
7 hear that officer. Now the other officer assisting

11 correct or do you know?

MS. WHIRLEY: On channel three. Can they 
17 transmit too. 
18 A Yes, I'm sure. Yeah. That's a North

7 So it is a repeating

9 whatever?

1 is that correct.

3 
A No, he wasn't assisting on a call. 
MS. ALIZADEH: The dispatcher we're going 
4 to hear the call. She's going to interpret for us 
5 who is going on. What does 10-8 mean, all this 
6 lingo that's said during these calls. She's going 
7 to be able to kind of translate that for us on what 
8 calls who was going on and who was assisting and so 
9 forth. 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: Maybe what you are talking 
11 about, we had asked what is he assigned to sector 
12 four and you said he was not? 
13 A No.

15 figure out what he was doing in that general 
16 location? 
17 
18 
19 
A 
A 
Right. 
MS. WHIRLEY: So can you tell us? 
He was on a prior call at a disturbance at 
20 one of our other apartment complexes and when he 
21 went 10-8 from there, he went onto a sick case at 
22 another apartment complex. He was in that general 
23 area anyway, four sector. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: And so it's not prohibitive 
25 for a sector car to leave their sector?

Q

(By Ms. Alizadeh) And you talk about the 
3 facts that sector has to go on call or leave their 
4 sectors that one of the roaming cars or cover cars 
5 might move into that area just to make sure there's 
6 coverage? 
7 A Uh-huh.

Q 
Country Club Hills. 
Country Club Hills officer who chimes and 
13 he's responding to a call in Ferguson, correct?

15 Q So other municipalities that are listening 
16 to this radio traffic, they can also come into your 
17 jurisdiction and respond to an emergency or 
18 something? 
19 A You got to remember we dispatch for two 
20 other municipalities, they are on our frequency and

8 out what happens on these radio calls. First of all 
9 the calls begin, the recordings begin in the middle 
10 of a shift, correct? 
A Yes. 11 
12 Q So there is other calls that we are not 
13 playing where officers were out on other calls. So 
14 when we start on the call, initially there is talk 
15 about a caller who says that a man with a gun, or a 
16 man has threatened her and he's left. He lives in 
17 the apartment complex and she thinks he might have 
18 left to go get a gun? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And this a subject maybe going to get a 
21 gun, would it be typical for more than one car to 
22 respond to that? 
23 A Yes. Officers hear that, they don't have 
24 to hear anything from the supervisor, that's all 
25 automatic for them. As long as they tell the

2 I will be en route. When they hear gun, you pretty 
3 much get the calvary coming into the area. There 
4 are several. 
5 Q We hear on those calls that the traffic 
6 amongst themselves and one guy says, I'm going to go 
7 behind the building and they're looking for somebody 
8 and they are communicating with themselves?

17 
18 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Yes. 
Only one of them it was his sector? 
Right. 
So other cars go there to assist? 
That officer whose sector that is, he was 
19 out on a sick case. The three officers are 
20 responding to that call are actually assisting that 
21 officer because he's out on another call.

4 something else, they know street numbers, they know 
5 street names, they know problem places, correct? 
6 A They know everything. Those officers, 
7 they could tell by the officer's tone of his voice 
8 that I need to get their quick, that's how the

11 today when we were listening to these calls that she

5 
A 
A 
Yes, ma'am. 
Do you know which complex? 
Parkridge Apartments. 
Parkridge Apartments. And 
6 then he went to a different complex to assist on a 
7 sick call. 
8 A No, he was actually the primary on that 
9 sick call, he was the only officer. When I say 
10 assist, when I say that, he assists in the sector 
11 car, so he doesn't have to jump off of that call to 
12 go run all the way over here. So when I say assist, 
13 he is just assisting the sector car. So he doesn't 
14 have to go 10-8 for the call. 
15 
16 
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) And 10-8 means? 
A Clear a call, I'm off the call. 
17 Q I'm done, I'm back in service, I can take 
18 another call? 
19 A Exactly. 
20 Now, when this happened, 
21 when this incident occurred, between him and Michael

The sick call that he had just gone 10-8 
2 from, was that, this is Grand Jury Exhibit Number 
3 25, which is a map, aerial map of the Canfield 
4 Apartment Complex. This is Canfield Drive, it 
5 continues on into Northwind Apartments? 
6 A Uh-huh. 
7 Q Was the sick call he was on this east side 
8 here? 
A Yes, ma'am. 9 
10 Q From there if he drives down Canfield, 
11 does he come out on West Florissant? 
12 A Yes, he does. 
13 I have a 
14 couple questions. 
15 When you showed us earlier that when you 
16 are on a channel that's not a real channel, you all 
17 have ten, somebody was on 13, they get a tone 
18 regardless of volumes? 
19 
20 
A Yes. 
21 way down, correct? 
22 A Yes. 
23 
That volume was all the 
Even in a dead zone? 
24 A Well, the walkie-talkies is going to be 
25 dead anyway, there is nothing on that channel even

1 in a dead zone you are going to. 
2 You are getting the tone 
3 from the dead channel, you aren't in the frequency 
4 of anything? 
5 
6 
A It doesn't have anything on it, right. 
And I'm trying to 
7 clarify. You said the dispatcher overrides the 
8 scans of the RIOT channel. If somebody is listening 
9 to the RIOT channel and the dispatcher from Ferguson 
10 comes on, all officers are needed at such and such, 
11 they will override, the officers will hear that? 
12 A They will go point-to-point, they won't go 
13 to the RIOT channel. Dispatchers will go to 
14 point-to-point. 
15 And the officers will 
16 hear that? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Point-to-point is hear 
19 only? 
20 A That's hear only, it is not a receiver. 
21 And I just had another 
22 question about you said that Officer Wilson had a 
23 newer model mobile device in his car? 
24 A 
25 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, ma'am. 
But he didn't have a

1 newer model portable walkie. 
2 A No, ma'am, they're still the old walkies. 
3 Does that have any 
4 bearing on what's being heard, what's being 
5 transmitted? 
6 A No. 
7 Seems like we have a lot 
8 of variables here. We have a newer mobile device, 
9 an old portable device, we have an area that's known 
10 to be a dead zone. We have different channel 
11 
12 
frequency. 
A 
I'm just trying to find out --
The newer radios, and I'm sure 
13 went through this, but the newer radios are going to 
14 be more microwaveable. So you are going to hear 
15 more from them, but they are still on the old 
16 system. 
17 Okay. 
18 A And that's because we're still on the old 
19 system with our walkies and our dispatch center. As 
20 soon as that 800 megahertz gets updated and ready to 
21 go. We'll have new walkies, which are coming pretty 
22 soon. We will have a new dispatcher center and new 
23 radios and everything will tie in together. 
24 Right now we are using a newer radio 
25 with our old system, which works just as good.

MS. ALIZADEH: If there are problems with 
2 the old system, the new radios aren't going to solve 
3 those problems? 
4 A No. 
5 Until you get the new 
6 system? 
7 A Right. The new system we shouldn't have 
8 dead zones, we shouldn't have problems. 
9 This is a real important 
10 question for me to understand. You said that you 
11 checked all the channels to see if a call was made 
12 from Darren Wilson on his portable to any other 
13 channel and you couldn't find one? 
14 A When I say that, we have certain channels 
15 on our recording device. We have what they call 
16 trunk systems. 911 we have five trunks. 
17 What it is, say you are dialing 911 
18 into me, then all of the sudden she dials 911 that 
19 will go to trunk two and then all of the sudden he 
20 dials 911, that's going to go to the next trunk 
21 system three. So we have a bunch of systems in 
22 there going because we constantly get 911 calls. 
23 So what I did was, I go back and 
24 check all the trunks on the 911 system and I also 
25 check point-to-point, I check the fire station, the

2 We have backup, our police backup. I 
3 will use the police backup because it is a clearer 
4 and more. I mean, you can hear everything in there. 
5 When you're on the backup system, you can actually, 
6 somebody wants a tape or something, I will just go 
7 straight to that. I won't just use the main channel 
8 because you don't get the static, you don't get the 
9 cars, people talking behind them. It will be a 
10 clearer sound. 
11 And then also we have our phone 
12 numbers. You know, we come in with 522-3100, then 
13 it keeps going. They have all the detectives' 
14 numbers in there and everything else. 
15 So the list of everything I'm looking 
16 at is probably about this long. (indicating) 
17 So with your experience 
18 and the information that you were able to tell, it 
19 does not appear as though he tried to make a all 
20 from his portable? 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: I'm going to clarify this 
22 because there are calls that are heard, but you 
23 can't tell what is being said?

3 it is coming from this radio is if it is the

5 
6 
7 
A Right. 
Okay. Thank you. 
I 
8 just have some clarification. You said that Frank 
9 22 and Frank 25 were dispatched on the way to the 
10 Ferguson Market incident; is that correct? 
11 A When the call came out of Ferguson Market, 
12 Frank 25 was actually the primary on that call. 
13 Okay. 
14 A You got to realize that apartment complex 
15 is only a block away, not even a block. So they're 
16 leaving that area and he is right there. All he has 
17 to do is come out of an entrance and go right into 
18 Ferguson Market. 
19 Okay. And then if I'm not 
20 mistaken, you said that, you said that Officer 
21 Darren Wilson, he called into dispatch to see if the 
22 officer needed any assistance, is that my 
23 understanding? 
24 A If he was needed in the area or whatever. 
25 I guess to help look for the subjects or something.

2 it? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q Now, you and I talked about that, about 
5 the ability of a dispatcher with your experience to 
6 understand what's being said when someone like me 
7 might listen to the call and say, okay, I didn't get 
8 that or I can't hear what's being said. Is that 
9 something that just comes with years of experience? 
10 
11 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And also, you also talked about, in fact, 
12 you talked about certain officers having a certain 
13 way of speaking. 
14 A Yes, some of them do. 
15 Q And one of the officers you said I can 
16 tell that's him, he'll always have a pause in his 
17 voice, like stops mid sentence and then completes a 
18 sentence? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Right. 
And you also said there is one officer who 
21 has got kind of a southern twang to his voice? 
22 
23 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
And did you also describe for me that you 
24 can also tell by the tone of the officer's voice

Right. 
Now, when the officers are out on patrol, 
4 are they supposed to notify you where they are and 
5 what they are up to at all times? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q So if an officer is on a call, when he 
8 finishes that call, does he call in and tell you 
9 he's done with the call? 
A Yes. 
Q And how does he do that? 
10 
11 
12 A He radios in using his call sign and let's 
13 us know that he's 10-8.

10-8? 
Yes. 
So that's 10-8? 
Yes, ma'am. 
That means I've completed that call and 
19 I'm back in service, I'm ready for another call? 
20 A Yes. 
21 Q So are there other things like bathroom 
22 breaks, I'm going on dinner break where they might 
23 use different codes?

1 transcript the officer will hear, will actually call 
2 in and then the dispatcher might repeat what the 
3 officer says; is that right? 
4 A Yes. 
Q Why do you do that? 5 
6 A To insure that all of the other officers 
7 hear what the transmission just was because 
8 sometimes the radio don't transmit and also to 
9 insure to that officer that I'm clear on what he 
10 said. 
11 Q Okay. And so if somebody calls in to 
12 dispatch and says something generally if everything 
13 is working properly and everything is good to go, 
14 the other officers are on the dispatch channel can 
15 hear that call, correct?

1 Q Do you know how many watts the transmitter 
2 is for dispatch? 
3 A That I do not know. 
4 Q Is your transmitter stronger than the 
5 mobile and portable transmitters? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. 
7 Q So generally speaking, the officers are 
8 always going to be, usually going to be able to hear 
9 dispatch, correct? 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q And we've also heard a lot of stuff about 
12 dead zones and that would be where officers might 
13 not be able to transmit or receive calls, correct? 
14 A Correct. 
15 Q Are there times when you can hear that 
16 there's an officer keying up a mike, in other words, 
17 he's pressing the button on his mike, but you don't 
18 hear speaking?

Yes. 
And can you tell that that's a call? 
You can tell, but a lot of times you can't

1 you know these guys' voices, is there anything on 
2 your monitor that tells you who is calling in? 
3 A No. 
4 Q So you only know by his voice or if he 
5 gives his call sign? 
6 A That is correct. 
7 Q You also, we talked today, can you tell 
8 the difference when an officer is calling in on a 
9 portable versus his mobile? 
A Yes. 10 
11 Q And what's the difference, how do you tell 
12 the difference? 
13 A The portable is not as strong and is 
14 clearer. A lot of times when they're on their 
15 portable you can hear static in the background 
16 whereas on the car radio, it is usually very crisp 
17 and clear. 
18 Q Okay. Now, we're going to play the 
19 transmissions and pass around the transcript. And I 
20 will tell you that the change, the handwriting 
21 that's on the transcript is mine. And I did that 
22 because it was, I first met with her this morning at 
23 6:30 is when you got here and that's the first time 
24 I had a chance to sit down and actually go through 
25 these transmissions with her. So I apologize, and

1 you would tell me sometimes when it would say on the 
2 transcript UI, which I assumes mean unintelligible, 
3 you are able to tell me what's being said sometimes? 
4 A Right. 
5 Q You saw me making changes, and sometimes 
6 with the officer it doesn't say who the officer was. 
7 You are able to tell me, well, that's 24 or that's 
8 25 or whatever?

Q 
Yes. 
And we talked about today on that day who 
11 was 21, who was 22 and so forth, correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. All right. Before we start playing 
14 the radio calls, is there anybody has a question 
15 about her job, or anything that she's testified to 
16 so far? 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: I actually do, not much, but 
18 hi, I'm over here. You mentioned that sometimes you 
19 could only hear static when an officer is trying to 
20 call in, I guess that's a dead zone or something? 
21 A Could be. Usually when you hear static, 
22 it is because they're in a building or maybe there's 
23 a building between them or some type of large 
24 structure between them and the radio waves don't get 
25 through that as easily as they would if they were

1 out in the open. 
2 MS. WHIRLEY: I think I heard you say that 
3 you cannot tell who's trying to call in on your 
4 monitors when you hear that static; is that correct? 
5 
6 
A That's correct, you cannot. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Is there anything in place 
7 to try to figure out, you know, who the officer is 
8 or what to do in case an officer might be needing 
9 help. 
10 A We have panic buttons that are installed 
11 in all of their walkies and also on the car radio. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: Is that that orange alert 
13 button we have heard about? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. If they push that, my radio 
15 console lights up and makes a lot of noise and each 
16 console does that, so we each have to shut them 
17 down. One of them did not shut them all down and 
18 that shows the officer's name, it shows whether he's 
19 on his portable or shows whether he's on his mobile 
20 in his car. 
21 MS. WHIRLEY: That's only if he hits that

1 and you just hear static, there is nothing you can 
2 do to try to figure out who that officer is or they 
3 need help? 
4 A Other than asking him to repeat, no, 
5 ma'am. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. And you said you also 
7 can detect a problem in the officer's voice, I think 
8 you said that, right? 
A Yes. 9 
10 MS. WHIRLEY: What do you do if you detect 
11 a problem, like something is going on and the 
12 officer is not asking for help, you detect 
13 something, what do you do? 
14 A I usually when there's a change in their 
15 voice, I usually send them help regardless, I send 
16 assist units. 
17 MS. WHIRLEY: You ask them do you need 
18 additional help?

1 is How often do the officers use that alert 
2 button, have you been known to happen a lot or? 
3 A It doesn't happen that often. I would 
4 even say once a month. It doesn't happen that 
5 often, but it does happen especially it is more an 
6 accident than not, but they'll hit it. 
7 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 86

9 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. I'm going to play a 
10 disc that is marked Grand Jury Exhibit Number 86, 
11 Vanna will now turn the letters. 
12 So the transept is being passed out. What 
13 I've written in there I wrote in after meeting with

1 911 calls. Those might not be in sync, would that 
2 be fair to say? 
3 A Correct. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So the clock that 
5 records these calls as they are being made might not 
6 be the actual time of the call, would that be fair 
7 to say? 
8 
9 
A 
Q 
Yes, there could be a discrepancy. 
Okay. But would it be also be fair to say 
10 that if there's a call that say 11:53 and 15 seconds 
11 and then the next call is at 11:54 and 15 seconds, 
12 that there would be a minute between those two 
13 calls, correct? 
14 A That's correct. 
15 Q So we can tell how much lag time in 
16 between calls by looking at the time, but that 
17 doesn't necessarily reflect what the actual time is? 
18 
19

Q 
Correct. 
Okay. Just for clarification sake, these

9 going to play these in order. If there's a need for

Q What does that mean? 
11 
12 
13 A That means he is unavailable for any calls 
14 and that he's at the station currently working on a

16 Q So Darren Wilson is saying that I'm 
17 available, but 28 is not?

Correct. 
And so 22 was not originally called by 
Correct. 
He heard the call? 
Yes. 
And so he says I'm going too? 
Yes, because when she put that out, she 
17 put that out for a unit and one to assist.

saying that?

And what does that mean? 
He, in our CAD system when we enter a 
5 call, they can see everything that we enter into the

7 we're entering information into the call before we 
8 physically put the unit on that call. He may not 
9 have seen himself assigned to that call. So he was 
10 just inquiring that and I were clear, he was

1 he means I'm at the scene? 
A Yes. 2 
3 Q And then responds to him saying you're 
4 at the scene and what's 11:34 mean? 
A That's the current time. 5 
6 Q So she's looked at the clock and she says 
7 what time it is on her clock? 
A Yes. 8 
9 Q So she has Frank 25, Officer Gibbons has 
10 arrived at the scene at 11:34? 
A Yes. 11 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: So the next track? 
13 When 
14 we're talking about the clock discrepancies. 
A Yes. 15 
16 Like track 323 was at 
17 11:46:04 and this is 11:34, there is like 12 minutes 
18 difference. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, you are looking at, 
20 when you say track 323, which is the first call I 
21 played, the time I gave you, the time and date is 
22 what is on the call, not the clock she's looking at. 
23 Right, that's what I'm 
24 saying, we're talking about the clock difference we 
25 are referring to earlier.

1 MS. ALIZADEH: There might be a difference 
2 in a clock. 
3 Right, right. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Actually, she says it's 
5 11:34 and that's 329. And this says it is 
6 August 9th, 2014 at 115321. 
7 Okay. Up there, good. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: So the clock they're 
9 looking at and calling out is the actual time, 
10 correct? 
11 
12 
A Yes. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So the times that are 
13 listed on here aren't the actual times, however, the 
14 time discrepancies I think would be accurate. So 
15 the 20 minutes from one call and then the next 
16 minute the call is 20 minutes later, I think that 
17 that would be accurate.

Q 
Q 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, I'm playing 330. 
(Playing of the recording.) 
Okay. Now, we've heard a lot of static at 
22 the beginning of that call. Can you tell if that 
23 officer is on his portable or on the mobile? 
24 A 
25 Q 
FAX 314-241-6750 
Yes, he's on his portable. 
Do you recognize who that is?

1 A You know it sounds like Officer Wilson, 
2 but it's hard to say. I would have to be closer in 
3 order to hear it. 
4 Q And so at the beginning when we are 
5 hearing static is that because somebody is keying up 
6 their mike or what was that static from? 
7 A That is because their on their mobile, I'm 
8 sorry, their portable and they're out walking on 
9 feet and as he's walking, he's moving in between the 
10 buildings. So the signal, instead of trying to bend 
11 around a building is straight and we can read it a 
12 lot better because there's not a building in the 
13 way. It is hard for me to explain that type. 
14 Q So would this be an example of a time when 
15 an officer is transmitting something and you can 
16 tell something is being transmitted, but you can't 
17 hear it and then as he continues to walk, you can 
18 hear what is being said? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
Okay. Because of the static you are not 
21 able to tell which officer that was?

3 A Yes.

5 A The second officer is Officer The 
6 first I'm not sure is possibly Officer Wilson.

10 instances where he has asked for backup? 
A Yes, ma'am. 11

13 
Is that my understanding? 
A Yes, ma'am. 
14 You said the length of 
15 time it took for him was out of character? 
16 A Yes, ma'am. 
17 Would there be a reason, 
18 Do you know of a reason for an officer 
19 to ask for backup that quickly? 
20 A Maybe because he felt that there was 
21 something about the way they looked, or the way they 
22 were acting or just that there was something 
23 suspicious about them. 
24 It could have been that 
25 they fit the description of the people at the

5 MS. WHIRLEY: Let me ask, do they 
6 generally, you mention a pedestrian check, do they 
7 generally get out of the car for a pedestrian check? 
8 A Most of the time, yeah, because they get 
9 out of the car and ask them for identification and I 
10 run them through the computer to insure they're not 
11 wanted. 
12 Q Knowing whether they are in the car or 
13 they are on their portable is generally they're not 
14 in their car on their mobile doing checks with 
15 pedestrians that are standing at the car?

17 a question about that because when he gets to 
18 Glenark, you ever notice that you guys, he never 
19 says I'm 23 or I"m out when he gets to Glenark? He 
20 just kind of says en route, we hear nothing from

16 guys. 
17 Best way I could explain it would be 
18 I will send officers from an adjoining sector if I 
19 have no officers available to respond. Meaning 
20 sectors that bump each other, that are close, I will 
21 put an officer from another sector to go there if 
22 someone needs help and there's not an officer 
23 available. 
24 I was just confused 
25 because that was his sector, it seems as though he

1 would have already been in the area, right? 
2 A Right. 
3 But he's not on none of 
4 the calls. 
5 A He was on Kirk, he was still on Kirk with 
6 the elderly patient. 
7 Oh, elderly patient, okay, 
8 all right. 
9 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Now, Glenark, if you 
10 look at that map and that's the call that Darren 
11 Wilson was on previous, correct? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Uh-huh. 
And that is going to be, if east is to the 
14 right, that's going to be east of that map, correct?

16 believe so, yes. 
17 Q Okay. And so you see that street Canfield 
18 that cuts through this?

1 do you guys need help regarding the incident, the 
2 stealing up in West Florissant, nobody responds to 
3 him and says no, we got it covered, never mind? 
4 A Correct. 
5 Q Does he have a say to anybody, hey, I'm 
6 going to go to this call at Ferguson Market? Do we 
7 know why he was driving down Canfield? 
8 A Canfield is a complete way for him to go 
9 from Glenark to West Florissant in sector one is up 
10 near the highway at West Florissant so that would 
11 have been a direct route for him to go to his 
12 sector. 
13 Q To return to his sector? 
14 A Yes, ma'am. 
15 Q From Glenark he would have to go down 
16 Canfield to get to West Florissant to go back to his 
17 sector? 
18 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
That would be a quick direct route, yes.

1 saying? 
2 A That is correct. 
3 If another officer is 
4 responding to that call because the main officer 
5 that's assigned there is doing something else, okay, 
6 when that officer is cleared that's normally 
7 assigned to that sector, he can't come back and then 
8 just take over for the officers that are there, you 
9 understand what? 
10 A Generally they do not. Generally the 
11 officer that has the report finishes the report, but 
12 I do understand what you are saying. 
13 Okay. 
14 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So if Officer Wilson is 
15 leaving a call and now he's going back in service 
16 and he hasn't been assigned anything, and he's 
17 headed back to his sector say, just assuming that. 
18 Is he allowed to do something in another sector? 
19 
20 
A 
Q 
Yes. 
So it is not like I can't stop these two

Why? 
Urn, because I know 25 was looking for

14 with me. So the years I've been there and I've 
15 known a lot of these men since they were small, I 
16 say small, to me they're like my children almost. 
17 I've known them since they were rookies. I'm 
18 concerned about their well being because it is odd 
19 for them not to talk to me.

7 ahold of anyone at the agency. He has requested and 
8 I've also tried United Way and they are not 
9 available.

12 you to try to get ahold of somebody with an agency

10 Is there interest in hearing them? Let me ask you 
11 this, do you ever hear Officer Wilson call out on 
12 the radio again? 
13 A No. 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Is there anybody who wants 
15 to listening to calls or you interested in whether 
16 there is a call for something specific? Anyone? 
17 We can keep playing the calls. It is a

19 need for additional units and so forth. 
20 I just have a question. 
21 At what point do you understand what 
22 happened or what the situation is? 
23 A I understood that there was a problem. I 
24 never fully knew what transpired until my captain

2 it is a time, correct? 
3 MS. ALIZADEH: Yes. You want me to double 
4 check the time? 
5 Well, no, I wrote it 
6 down. I know that's what was on the track. 
7 And then on 378, that's if we have a 
8 detective on duty respond as well. So that's pretty 
9 much, we can say that's pretty much after everything 
10 is done as far as the shooting that was at 12:23:11, 
11 which was like two seconds or is that two minutes. 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: Two minutes. 
13 This whole thing pretty 
14 much was over in two minutes, that's a fairly short 
15 period of time. So, I mean, we are hearing people

11 We just finished with our lunch break and

15 of a press conference or press conferences that 
16 Chief gave or made after the incident in 
17 Ferguson. 
18 So I did find online several clips or 
19 press conferences. And I'm not 100 percent sure 
20 which one you might be referring to, so I know that 
21 there was a question of whether or not he talked 
22 about whether the officer knew or what he might have 
23 known. 
24 So I have two, I have two clips where that 
25 might be what he's talking about.

1 everybody for coming out. Sorry about being late, I 
2 know that the timeline hasn't really played out like 
3 I expected it would. But as some of you are aware, 
4 I've had a lot of Sunshine request, Sunshine Law 
5 request for information and documents about a 
6 variety of things, some of which is not available to 
7 me. 
8 But anyway, I'm here to talk about two 
9 things. First of all, the name of the officer 
10 involved in the shooting and then I've had a lot of 
11 Sunshine request for information I'm going to be 
12 releasing information about a robbery that occurred 
13 on August 9th immediately preceding the altercation 
14 and shooting death of Michael Brown. 
15 It's important to know that I have made 
16 contact with someone who is in contact with 
17 Officer Brown's (sic) family making them aware of 
18 this information being released. 
19 What we are making available today is the 
20 dispatch records, the video footage of a robbery, a 
21 strong armed robbery, a use of force that occurred 
22 at a local convenience mart. 
23 I cannot discuss the investigation 
24 about the attempted apprehension of the suspect and 
25 strong armed robbery, that goes to the County

1 Prosecutor's office. I won't be taking any 
2 questions today right now, but I won't be taking any 
3 questions here. I want to get this information to 
4 you, everybody digest it and then later on sometime 
5 in the afternoon we can get together again and then 
6 I'll take questions. 
7 So I just want to give you a little 
8 timeline of what happened. On August 9th from 
9 11:48 till noon the officer involved in the shooting 
10 was on a sick call on Glenark. There was an 
11 ambulance present. 
12 At 11:51 there was a 911 call from a 
13 convenience store nearby, not this one. At 
14 11:52 dispatch gave a description of a robbery 
15 suspect over the radio. A different officer arrived 
16 at the store where the strong armed robbery 
17 occurred. 
18 A further description with more 
19 detail was given over the radio and said that the 
20 officer was walking toward -- the suspect was 
21 walking toward QuikTrip. 
22 Our officer left the sick call, he 
23 encountered the, sorry. At 12:01 p.m., our officer 
24 encountered Michael Brown on Canfield Drive. At 
25 12:04 a second officer arrived on the scene

1 immediately following the shooting. And 12:05 a 
2 supervisor was dispatched to the scene and 
3 subsequent officers arrived. 
4 There has been some questions about 
5 the calling of an ambulance, the ambulance that was 
6 at the sick case on Glenark was coming by 
7 immediately following the shooting and they did 
8 respond to assess Michael Brown. 
9 So I'm going to have some police 
10 officers going to be handing out packets that have 
11 all the information that was requested on the 
12 Sunshine request concerning the robbery. We're 
13 going to give those packets, first of all, to those 
14 agencies that had made the Sunshine request and then 
15 anybody else who wants them, I think we have enough 
16 to give out. We've got quite a few. 
17 Sorry. The officer that was involved 
18 in the shooting of Michael Brown was Darren Wilson. 
19 He's been a police officer for six years, has had no 
20 disciplinary action taken against him. 
21 He was treated for injuries which 
22 occurred on Saturday. Again, I won't be taking any 
23 questions at this time, but the packets will be 
24 handed out by my officers. The name is Darren,

7 marked for identification.) 
8 (Playing of the recording of the press 
9 conference and the following is a transcription:) 
10 CHIEF Okay, thank you. All 
11 right. So I gave you a whole bunch of, first of 
12 all, thank you for coming out here. We wanted to do 
13 this in this environment so we can hear each other 
14 and get whatever information we have left out. 
15 So I gave you a lot of information this 
16 morning. I wanted to give you a chance to let you 
17 go over it. And if we've had some questions that 
18 have been coming into our Twitter and so forth, so 
19 I'm going to a address some of those. 
20 A question about the timing of the release 
21 of the tape. So we have had this tape for a while 
22 and you know we had to diligently review the 
23 information that was in the tape, determine if there 
24 was any other reason to keep it, anybody else to be 
25 charged in the crime, we had determined that that

Page 172 
1 was not going to be the case. 
2 We got a lot of Freedom of Information 
3 request for this tape and at some point it was just 
4 determined we had to release it. We didn't have 
5 good cause or any other reason to not release it. 
6 And so decided at the same time it wouldn't be 
7 prudent to release that information which, you know, 
8 could be a little bit, I don't know. 
9 We needed to release that at the same time 
10 we would release the name of the officer who was 
11 involved in the shooting. So that we could just 
12 keep open and give you all the information we had. 
13 We pretty much have given you every bit of 
14 information that we have now. I don't think there 
15 is anything else that we have to give out. 
16 Regarding the second suspect who was in 
17 the store and the tape, Dorian Johnson, we 
18 determined that he did not commit a crime and was 
19 not complicit in the crime. 
20 And clarifying one of the other questions 
21 that came quite a bit was on the role of two 
22 officers. Some were thinking it was the same 
23 officer that handled the robbery as was involved in 
24 the shooting, that is not the case. There were two 
25 separate officers.

1 This robbery does not relate to the 
2 initial contact between the officer and Mike Brown. 
3 Having said that, I will take a few questions. 
4 QUESTION: Do you have any information to 
5 justify the incident of force, particularly outside 
6 department? 
7 CHIEF Okay. I understand that 
8 and these are questions that have to go to the 
9 investigation and I don't think anything from the 
10 investigation is going to be released until it is 
11 complete. 
12 QUESTION: The officer who fired the shots 
13 whether he knew Mr. Brown was involved in this 
14 incident, whether he knew that Mr. Brown was 
15 involved? 
16 CHIEF I can only go up to a 
17 certain point and then it is unreleased information 
18 in the investigation. And that certain point is the 
19 initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown 
20 was not related to the robbery.

23 a weapon was discharged?

(Inaudible.) 
Okay. All I did was 
12 release the videotape to you because I had to. I've 
13 been sitting on it. Too many people put in a 
14 request for that thing so I had to release that tape 
15 to you. 
16 QUESTION: (Inaudible.) 
17 CHIEF I understand that, but 
18 considering if I just release that tape and didn't 
19 release the officer's name, there would be similar 
20 questions. 
21 QUESTION: Michael Brown's family was the

24 intended to assassinate the character of Michael

5 we can give you. From our police department you

13 with their attorney. 
14 QUESTION: We asked you guys questions 
15 about the way you handled this case happened this 
16 case why you are releasing the information you said 
17 was under investigation, you just put more citizens 
18 in trouble by releasing that video. Now they have 
19 to be protected because their store and their 
20 business have been placed in the media. You say you

4 A Not a personal relationship, just

6 MS. WHIRLEY: Just one of your officers?

2 Q (By Ms. Whirley) You are familiar with 
3 that, of course. Is that something the officers are 
4 taught about or have training on how did to use that 
5 button and when to use that button?

8 MS. WHIRLEY: Is this the kind of incident 
9 that you would have imagined or expected for an

13 yes.

1 Something like his 
2 obviously happened very quickly, would it be unusual 
3 not to have that button pushed? I mean, are 
4 surprised it's not or in your experience it may not? 
5 A I don't know whether it was pushed or not, 
6 I don't. 
7 If it was not, would you 
8 be surprised necessarily? 
9 A No, not necessarily. 
10 Okay. 
11 Officer 
12 Wilson when he testified before indicated to us that 
13 he did not carry a taser. And his reason for such 
14 is that it was uncomfortable to carry. I mean, is 
15 it standard procedure for an officer to dictate what 
16 he will and will not carry. 
17 A Urn, under the circumstances tasers, I 
18 didn't know that he didn't carry the taser until 
19 after the incident that day. We have a limited 
20 number of tasers. 
21 When I actually got to the Ferguson 
22 Police Department, there were a lot deficiencies 
23 that I wanted to correct, and one of them was there 
24 were too many incidents where a taser could have 
25 been used, but we didn't have them.

1 So I set about trying to locate some 
2 money and just buy a few at a time. We don't have a 
3 taser assigned to each officer, but we're trying to 
4 improve that. 
5 Okay. Just in addition to 
6 that, how long has this been known you don't have 
7 enough tasers for every officer, I mean, when did 
8 you discover the problem? 
9 A They didn't have enough? 
10 About the lack of amount 
11 of tasers. 
12 A There were no tasers when I started 
13 working there at all. 
14 Okay. 
15 A I bought five with some grant money that I 
16 was able to dig up and with some asset sharing. And 
17 then as I got another grant, I bought a few more. 
18 Uh-huh. 
19 A I'm trying to get enough so that each 
20 officer will have his own personal. 
21 When you get this grant, 
22 is it a grant, urn, that is specifically set out for 
23 those tasers? Like when you feel that you need some 
24 tasers or whatever, do you initiate this grant, I 
25 want X amount of money, I need five more tasers.

1 A It is more, that's pretty much the case, 
2 ma'am. We get notified or we search for grants that 
3 are available. 
4 Uh-huh. 
5 A In this case I think this was through the 
6 State Cops Program that there would be an 
7 application process for grants. So you have the 
8 opportunity to say, I have this need, then you have 
9 to have explain the need and justify it and then say 
10 how much money you would like to have. 
11 And then they decide how much money 
12 they are going to give you, if any. 
13 When you receive the 
14 money, you put in, say you put in for the tasers, 
15 okay. You get the grant money delivered to you or

17 comes up that you feel now is more warranted. Do

MS. ALIZADEH: I want to clarify whether 
22 or not they needed more tasers in the Ferguson

24 something that needs to be addressed at this point,

1 you're now aware that Officer Wilson did not have a 
2 taster on his person; is that right. 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Were officers required 
5 to carry a taster at that time? 
6 A No. 
7 Q So was it up to the individual officers to 
8 decide whether he was going to carry a taser? 
9 A Pretty much, yes. This is a less lethal 
10 may be used and precisely we didn't have enough for 
11 everybody. 
12 Q Is it possible that there could be more 
13 officers working a shift than there would be tasers 
14 available for that shift? In other words, maybe six 
15 officers working and maybe at the time you only have 
16 five tasers that were actually working at the time? 
17 A That is possible. I don't know if that 
18 was the case here.

1 your protocol when it comes for one of your police 
2 officers, maybe another scene just happened on 
3 August the 9th, do you, was it your own authority or 
4 opinion not to speak to him about what happened at 
5 the scene or was you instructed? 
6 A No, ma'am, it was my decision to turn the 
7 entire investigation over to St. Louis County Police 
8 Department and to separate myself, my detectives 
9 from that. I just believe 35 years in law 
10 enforcement we not only have to be impartial and 
11 fair, but there also has to be no appearance of 
12 impropriety. 
13 It just seems like an agency, I came 
14 from a very big police department, moved to a very 
15 small police department. Small, much smaller police 
16 department and it just seems that the department 
17 that size needs to move something this critical like 
18 a fatal officer shooting to a larger law enforcement 
19 agency or particularly a different law enforcement 
20 agency to handle. 
21 Also I don't believe that 
22 Officer Wilson had mace either, did you know that?

1 have like a captain like protocol command so someone 
2 checking their uniforms before they leave the 
3 department. 
4 A Yes, ma'am, we have roll call and the 
5 supervisor is responsible for making sure of those 
6 things. 
7 I'm going to 
8 go back to what nine has. Is mace required because 
9 I thought he said he had mace but didn't spray it 
10 because it was too close in the vehicle for it not 
11 to affect him. 
12 If I could say something, 
13 I believed the reaction that he 
14 gets from it would cause more problem or cause him 
15 to be more debilitated. 
16 That was my question. 
17 Did you recall the he had it or did not? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: At this point rather than 
19 discussing the witness' testimony, I have provided 
20 you all the transcript previously because there was 
21 a question about another point of another witness' 
22 testimony. So if you want to ask this witness 
23 questions about what his knowledge or information 
24 was or the policies or protocols, I'm not cutting 
25 you off from asking that question, but talking about

1 what other people might have said, probably better 
2 to go back and refer to the transcript. 
3 Mace is not required? 
4 A Mace is issued to each officer so they 
5 are, issued equipment is expected to be carried but 
6 it is going to be largely to the officers discretion 
7 which item to use. For example, I would not be in 
8 very close quarters use pepper mace. 
9 But you would expect your 
10 officer to have it on him? 
A I would expect. 11 
12 
13 
When he's on patrol? 
A Yes. 
14 So in 
15 your career in law enforcement have you ever been 
16 dealt with or been involved in any way in other 
17 officer involved shooting? 
18 A Yes. 
19 So my kind of question 
20 onto that is, in other words, there was talk about 
21 how the officer left the scene in this incident. He 
22 left by himself in Sergeant vehicle, went 
23 back to the station to wash his hands, is that some 
24 typical protocol? Should he have been escorted? I 
25 don't know, I'd just like to know.

A That's news to me too, but I would of had 
someone else take him to the station. I certainly 
3 had someone else take him to the hospital. 
4 If you could, maybe, in 
5 your role in your experience before working at 
6 Ferguson, what was the relationship with the 
7 community, the police department in the community. 
8 A In my four years there excellent. We have 
9 nine community associations, neighborhood 
10 associations in Ferguson. And I'm very well 
11 acquainted with all the members of those. Go to a 
12 lot of their meetings. I send my officers there to 
13 give them crime updates every month at their 
14 meetings. 
15 I attend all the events, I sing the 
16 national anthem for them at the 4th of July and the 
17 beginning of the 5K run that we have every year. It 
18 is a very active, involved community. 
19 MS. WHIRLEY: What about Canfield Green, 
20 the folks that live in the Canfield Green 
21 Apartments, are they involved in these associations 
22 and active with the police? 
23 A We were trying very hard to get 
24 associations over there and neighborhood watches 
25 over there. We went over, it is a big complex as

1 you probably know. Canfield Green runs into the 
2 Northwinds Estates, runs into Oakmont, they are all, 
3 it is a very dense community. So we were trying to 
4 get neighborhood watch in there. 
5 So we do things such as we have 
6 resource displays where we bring the dogs, 
7 firetrucks and the officers over there and everyone, 
8 every resident gets a copy of the Ferguson Times 
9 that says all the events are happening, things like 
10 that. 
11 It has been difficult to get a 
12 neighborhood association going over in there. 
13 MS. WHIRLEY: Why do you think that is? 
14 A Probably a lot of it has to do with the 
15 transient population. People don't plan on living 
16 there for long periods of time, so they don't get 
17 deeply involved in the community. 
18 But we also did several things with 
19 all of those apartments, you know, try to improve 
20 quality of life and reduce crime in those areas. We 
21 were very involved in there.

2 MS. WHIRLEY: Were you concerned or did 
3 you have any thoughts about the information that we 
4 now know and you may know, I don't know, that as you 
5 said the initial contact with Michael Brown was when 
6 Officer Wilson told them to get out of the middle of 
7 the street and then he backed up, I guess at this 
8 point he may have known about this stealing at the 
9 Ferguson Market, he backs up, and, you know, he's 
10 confronting Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson from 
11 his car. Is that something that's pretty much 
12 standard is to sit in your car and investigate a 
13 potential robbery or stealing. 
14 A No, it is my understanding is that he was 
15 trying to get out of his car. 
16 MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
17 A But again, this is, you know, second, 
18 third hand information. I have not asked for any of 
19 the evidence.

1 appropriate, I guess, if you notice these two 
2 suspects and you put your car in reverse, would it 
3 be, I guess, okay to put your sirens on or not even 
4 your sirens, your flashing lights and turn your 
5 lights on to let, I guess, the community know 
6 something is going on here? 
7 A Not necessarily. I don't think that would 
8 be either a bad or good thing, it is neutral. 
9 Even with traffic kind of 
10 coming both ways there? 
11 A If it is going to be blocking traffic in 
12 the street, yeah, that would probably be 
13 appropriate, yes, sir. 
14 In regards to field 
15 training, I have a question continuing on the 
16 previous comment, when he pulled back in reverse, 
17 from Officer Wilson's perspective and others, he 
18 says himself he impeded their traffic, he backed his 
19 car up to prevent them from going anywhere. Is that 
20 also, is that protocol, is that something you would 
21 expect an officer to do, kind of use the vehicle to 
22 in that manner? 
23 A To use the vehicle?

15 You said you didn't 
16 realize how things were handled after he went back 
17 to the station by himself, he washed his hands and 
18 everything, and so I was just wondering if, and you 
19 said you didn't know that, but is that not the way 
20 you would, you would have expected that to be 
21 handled? 
22 A Right, but in this particular case, I 
23 separated myself from all of this. I'm going to 
24 have to do my own investigation, internal affairs, 
25 when this is over.

I've got one more 
question. In one of your press conferences, 
3 , you state that evidence was found on 
4 Michael Brown from the robbery.

6 
A Yeah, I saw that too. I'm not sure I

10 you were in the academy, what was your training on 
11 deadly force, when to use it and how much to use it

20 deadly force?

1 education. The post-training they are required 
2 where it includes firearms training, deadly force 
3 training every year. A lot of it is dictated by 
4 both state and federal law and Supreme Court 
5 decisions that sometimes change circumstances and 
6 deadly force. Fleeing felon rule, for example. 
7 Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) So let me ask, I know 
8 and maybe this hasn't been testified about, but 
9 officers have to get continuing education to 
10 maintain their certification every year; is that 
11 right? 
12 
13 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
So every year officers have to have so 
14 many hours of continuing education, correct? 
15 
16 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
And that's put on by various organizations 
17 and entities, would that be fair to say? 
18 
19 
A 
Q 
Yes, ma'am. 
And so there might be other entities that 
20 would give additional instruction or training on use 
21 of force to affect an arrest and the use of deadly 
22 force, but my question is, does your department 
23 itself train or instruct the officer, or is there 
24 any kind of formalized training in your department, 
25 put on by your department about use of force?

Yes, ma'am. 
And is that done as like in the form of 
3 giving them some written materials, or is that done 
4 as in some kind of class setting? 
5 A We have our own firearms range, it is an 
6 inside range. All of our firearms training is done 
7 in-house. So it is done annually. 
8 Q Do you have a particular officer who then 
9 does the instruction on using force during an arrest 
10 to affect an arrest or the use of deadly force? 
11 A That's through the continuing education. 
12 That would be through the police academy or North 
13 County Chiefs Association Training, or outside 
14 training, that's all part of continuing education.

4 A Yes, ma'am. 
5 Q And those general orders are written by 
6 who? 
7 A Urn, when I got there four and a half years 
8 ago, I was not satisfied with the policy manual so I 
9 set out to mirror, to get a complete general orders 
10 manual policies and procedures for an agency our 
11 size that mirrored CALEA. 
Q What's CALEA? 12 
13 A The Commission For Accreditation of Law 
14 Enforcement Agencies, it is international. It is 
15 very expensive to get that done. So I started with 
16 the State of Missouri certification process, which 
17 takes several years. 
18 We developed a complete general 
19 orders manual, so as those general orders came out, 
20 the officers were required to and often times we 
21 would have supervisors or officers present training, 
22 train each other on those general orders. 
23 Q Okay. So you have a specific general 
24 order regarding the use of force to effect an arrest 
25 and the use of deadly force during an arrest?

Could we get a copy of that general orders

Q 
Yes. 
If the grand jurors wanted it? 
MS. WHIRLEY: Excuse me, I just want to 
7 ask for the orders. Are there any orders as to what 
8 the protocol would be after a shooting has occurred?

10 
11 
A 
Q 
Urn, I'm trying to think. Yes, there are. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay. 
(By Ms. Alizadeh) And so you said that the 
12 general orders that once you took over you were kind 
13 of revamping them? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q That's my word, revamping. In doing so, 
16 were you trying to make them compliant with the law. 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And you also said that you were attempting 
19 to have them hear other possible state 
20 organizations' policy and so forth? 
21 A Yes, to create the most professional 
22 organization that I could. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, do you have any 
24 more question? 
25

1 I heard both 
2 of you use the phrase use of weapon to affect an 
3 arrest and use of deadly force. Can you tell me 
4 what the difference between those two are? 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: I had said use of force to 
6 affect an arrest and then use of a deadly weapon, 
7 use of deadly force. 
8 Okay. We've heard a lot 
9 about in the media, can you tell me the difference 
10 between those two? 
A Between use of force? 11 
12 MS. WHIRLEY: Use of force to affect an 
13 arrest and use of deadly force. 
14 A Okay. Force actually in the force 
15 continuum which is taught in the academy starts with 
16 the presence of the uniform. 
17 Okay. 
18 A Then it goes to hands on, maybe just 
19 compliance holds, and then it can go to fighting. 
20 Then you have less lethal option such as the taser, 
21 bean bang rounds, pepper mace, there's also stick 
22 batons, those are all not considered, for example, 
23 the baton and the taser are considered less lethal. 
24 There's a possibility that they could be, but it is 
25 considered less lethal weapon.

1 And then finally when you get to 
2 deadly force, that would be a firearm in the 
3 continuum. 
4 Tell me, are the officers 
5 taught where to shoot specifically if they have to 
6 get to that point? 
7 A Yes, ma'am. 
8 
9 lower extremity? 
10 
11 
A No, it is not. 
12 part of the body?

14 
15 
16 
A Yes, ma'am. 
A Yes, ma'am. 
And it is never in the 
It is always in the upper 
So that's their training? 
In your 
17 policies or procedures, is there anything ever 
18 addressed or have you seen it addressed in your four 
19 years there when you are affecting or potentially 
20 trying to detain somebody or affect an arrest, is it 
21 ever mentioned trying to grab somebody out a car 
22 window to detain them? 
23 A 
24 
25 A 
FAX 314-241-6750 
No, no. 
Have you ever heard that? 
No. Generally the force necessary to

1 affect the arrest is what the standard is. 
2 Okay. But not 
3 specifically, whatever you do, wherever you are 
4 potentially to reach out a car window and detain 
5 somebody? 
6 A No. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Chief would you 
8 expect one of your officers to attempt to arrest a 
9 suspect simply because they were walking in the 
10 middle of the street? 
11 A Arrest, no. I would expect that they 
12 would ask them to move to the sidewalk. And then if 
13 they refused, they can be issued a summons for that. 
14 Much like a traffic ticket. 
15 Race is not 
16 mentioned today in our conversation, but I would 
17 like to know what the officer thought or assume as a 
18 white officer and a black suspect? 
19 A Can I ask you, my years of flying a 
20 helicopter, that ear is not 
21 Race has been a huge 
22 factor, what the officer assumed or thought of the 
23 suspect before he saw him. So my question to you 
24 is, one, do you feel like your department racially, 
25 the kind of racial diversity, does that reflect the

1 Ferguson community or not? 
2 A I think that I've made an effort since I 
3 got there to increase racial diversity because of 
4 the make up of the community. It is very difficult 
5 with an agency my size. 
6 I did, probably heard me say this, 
7 when I got there, there had never been an 
8 African-American supervisor on the police 
9 department. I promoted the first two in the 
10 history, I'm very proud of that. And I've tried 
11 hard to recruit minority candidates, but again, St. 
12 Louis County, there's St. Louis City, there's 
13 Missouri State Highway Patrol, there is federal 
14 agencies, you know, it is difficult to recruit and 
15 retain. 
16 So knowing that and 
17 knowing that's an area for growth. 
18 A Yes. 
19 Would you say with your 
20 department, is there any steps in place or any 
21 action taken to help educate on social diversity or 
22 how to interact with those maybe, whether it is 
23 beliefs or whatever that may be, anything you do 
24 department wide.

1 officers receive that type of training as part of 
2 their recertification every three years. So there 
3 is annual racial profiling or diversity training 
4 which is required. 
5 MS. WHIRLEY: And there's a lot of other 
6 training that's out there. 
7 Recently we, of course, we doubled our 
8 efforts. Some of my commanders just attended a 
9 really good bias policing training put on by the 
10 Cops Program. I have met with the National Director 
11 from Cops and we talked a lot about some of the new 
12 and young and exciting training in adversity that's 
13 out there, but this training actually had citizens 
14 and police officers in the training. It was a real 
15 good environment. 
16 Okay. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody else have any

5 After we played that, we're going to play
