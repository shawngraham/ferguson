3 MS. WHIRLEY: Good morning. Present is 
4 Shirley Whirley, Kathi Alizadeh, the 12 jurors and 
5 the court reporter. This is September the lOth, 
6 2014. This morning we are going to start out by 
7 watching a series of video clips that depict Dorian 
8 Johnson discussing what he saw as an eyewitness in 
9 this case. 
10 As you recall, Dorian Johnson was the 
11 person who was with Mike Brown at the time of the 
12 shooting. 
13 There is approximately six video clips 
14 that you will see. And once you see those videos, 
15 then we'll also provide you with a transcript and an 
16 interview. I think it is approximately two hours 
17 and 13 minutes, something like that, interview that 
18 Dorian Johnson gave to the FBI, and St. Louis County 
19 Police were also present. So you will hear his 
20 statement to them. 
21 And then after that, we'll likely break 
22 for lunch and when we resume in the afternoon, we 
23 anticipate that Dorian Johnson will testify. 
24 So with that bit of an introduction, Kathi 
25 Alizadeh is operating the laptop to get us started.

MS. ALIZADEH: 
MS. WHIRLEY: 
MS. ALIZADEH: 
Just for explanation. 
This is audio. 
No, these are video. 
Okay. 
These are videos that 
7 on news outlets and some of them, some of these 
Page 6 
were 
8 clips contain other statements from other people, 
9 comments reporters have made about the incident. 
10 And as much as possible, I want to exclude those. 
11 So it will take me a second, I have my 
12 notes where we are starting and stopping on these 
13 and it will take me a second on each clip to get to 
14 that point. And then we will start it and you will 
15 see that clip. 
16 The only time you will hear from a 
17 reporter is when they're asking questions of Dorian 
18 Johnson, obviously, to understand his statement, you 
19 need to hear the questions. 
20 So as much as I can, I'm going to get to 
21 wherever I need to get. I'm hoping that when I hit 
22 this, we are going to see it and hear it. 
23 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 9 
24 marked for identification.) 
25 MS. ALIZADEH: This is what I've marked,

1 it is a disc, it is marked Grand Jury 9. I didn't 
2 stay last night to look at my exhibits, I'm hoping 
3 that's the next number. 
4 This is a disc that contains video clips 
5 of interviews of Dorian Johnson and the first clip 
6 is on KTVI. The date of the interview is 8/9/14 and 
7 I'm starting this clip at one minute and seven 
8 seconds into the clip, and I am going to stop it at 
9 one minute and 20 seconds into the clip. None of 
10 these are terribly long. They are news clips. 
(We have a pause.) 11 
12 MS. ALIZADEH: Just for the record, we had 
13 a brief break because we were having difficulty with 
14 the audio. I think we have that resolved. So once 
15 again, and actually now this is starting at 106 and 
16 I will try to stop it at 120. 
17 (Playing the video at this time) 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: So I stopped that at 120. 
19 Is there anybody that needs to see that again and 
20 hear that again? 
21 Yeah, I need to see it 
22 again. It looks like the volume was up kind of 
23 loud, I can't pick up what he's saying. If you 
24 would put that at like half. 
25 (Playing the video clip.)

So the next is a clip from CNN. The date 
4 is August 12th of 2014. I'm starting the recording 
5 at 19 seconds into the clip and I will end it at six 
6 minutes and six seconds into the clip. 
7 (Playing the clip.) 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody want to hear 
9 that again? The next clip is KSDK on August 12th of 
10 this year, 2014. I'm playing starting at actually 
11 29 seconds and I will stop it at two minutes and 40 
12 seconds. 
13 (Playing the clip.) 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody want to hear that

16 
17 Miss Kathi, what date was the second video? 
18 MS. ALIZADEH: Second video was on the

20 That was the 12th. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: So the next video is MSNBC, 
22 it is also on August 12th of this year. I'm going 
23 to start it at 27 seconds and it goes to a minute 47 
24 seconds. And actually, immediately after this clip 
25 is another MSNBC clip that is a continuation of that

1 interview you will see a little overlap, but this 
2 interview sounds like it kind of gets cut off, but 
3 then on the next clip it continues. 
4 (Video clip is being played.) 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody want to see that 
6 part again? 
7 So again, the next clip is also MSNBC and 
8 it is a continuation of the same show or program. 
9 I'm going to start it at the beginning of this clip. 
10 So zero seconds and it runs until nine minutes and 
11 21 seconds and then continues onto the next clip as 
12 well. 
13 (Video clip being played.) 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Does anybody want to see 
15 that again? It continues onto the next clip. 
16 
17 
(Video clip is being played.) 
MS. ALIZADEH: So I'm continuing the next 
18 clip. You can see it started with the last question 
19 that he asked on the previous clip, so this next 
20 clip will go from zero to 24 seconds. And this is 
21 also again it is MSNBC on August 12th. 
22 (Video clip is being played.) 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: I actually stopped it at 29 
24 seconds accidently, asleep at the switch. 
25 Anybody want so see that brief clip again?

And then this is the last clip. This is 
2 KSDK also on the 13th, I'm sorry, it was aired on 
3 the 13th. I think what you will see is that this is 
4 a part of an interview that was done, and you 
5 actually saw a part of the same interview in the 
6 third clip I played, which was aired on the 12th. 
7 So I believe this interview occurred on 
8 the 12th, not the 13th, but this, but this aired on 
9 the 13th. So it is 33 seconds. 
10 I'm going stop it a two minutes and 40 
11 seconds. 
12 (Video clip is being played at this time.) 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So that is the last 
14 clip on Grand Jury Exhibit Number 9. Does anybody 
15 want to see that again or any other clips? 
16 And again, this is available to you at any 
17 time, you know, during this investigation. You want 
18 to hear it or see it again, we'll make sure you have 
19 the opportunity to do that.

2 Right now we're going to play the recorded 
3 interview of Dorian Johnson which occurred on August 
4 the 13th, 2014. An interview he had with the, an 
5 agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
6 also a detective from St. Louis County. 
7 This interview is approximately two hours 
8 and 13 minutes long. We provided you with 
9 transcripts of the interview. You can write on 
10 these transcripts if you wish. 
11 Kathi, did you have something else you 
12 want to say about that? 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: At any time, you know, we 
14 discussed this during the break that if, since this 
15 is over two hours long, if anybody needs to take a 
16 break in the middle of it, let me know, I will try 
17 to find a place where it is kind of a pause to stop. 
18 And there was a question during the break 
19 by one of the jurors about whether you can ask 
20 witnesses questions when they testify. And I know 
21 you have been so far, but of course, that's true of 
22 any witness. 
23 We don't have a witness right now, this is 
24 just obviously the audio interview, but any time a 
25 witness is before you and been sworn in, you may

1 inquire of anything that you think is relevant and 
2 we want you to. 
3 Sheila and I will ask questions of 
4 witnesses as we have been going on. If at any time 
5 you want to inquire, anything is relevant. There is 
6 no, there is no objections to questions and we would 
7 have in a courtroom or anything of that nature, 
8 okay. 
9 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 10 
10 marked for identification.) 
11 MS. ALIZADEH: So with that being said, 
12 I'm going to play Grand Jury Exhibit 10, which is a 
13 DVD and it is an audio recording, and for the 
14 record, this DVD contains a number of interviews of 
15 other witnesses. And so for the record, I'm going 
16 to be playing the interview of Dorian Johnson and 
17 Sheila said the transcript of that interview is 
18 given to you. 
19 (Interview is being played at this time.) 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody want to take a 
21 break right now or keep going? 
22 It is 11:17, let's take about a five 
23 minute or so break and stand up and move around a 
24 little bit.

5 (End of the playing of the interview of 
6 Mr. Johnson.) 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: It is 12:13, I think your 
8 lunch is going to be here at 12:30. What I would 
9 propose we do because this is not going to take very 
10 long at all is that I have what I've marked as Grand 
11 Jury Exhibit 11. 
12 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 11 
13 marked for identification.) 
14 MS. ALIZADEH: Which is another disc or 
15 DVD and it contains video from the Ferguson Market, 
16 the incident you heard Dorian Johnson talk about. 
17 They went in, got the Cigarillos and left the store. 
18 They are pretty brief clips. You want to watch them 
19 now since we have 15 minutes and then I thought 
20 during lunch, you also heard during his interview 
21 that he was drawing on some maps and we have copies 
22 of those maps. And also he made a drawing I can't 
23 find it in my office right now, I think Sheila might 
24 have one. 
25 I thought while you are eating lunch, you

1 can pass around those maps and look at them as you 
2 are relaxing if you want to. This will only take a 
3 couple minutes. You all right with me playing this 
4 now? 
5 So for the record a DVD, that on the DVD 
6 itself it says 14-43984, and it says video segments. 
7 There is no audio with this disc. 
8 (Video is being played at this time.) 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: Now, for the record that 
10 was called register snippet and that was a view of 
11 where the cash register is and the counter is. 
12 So this next snippet, it is called door 
13 snippet. It is at the door of the food store, the 
14 convenience store. 
15 (Playing of the video clip.) 
16 MS. ALIZADEH: Would anybody like to see 
17 those snippets again? And of course, you can watch 
18 them at any other time you wish. 
19 Can we ask you a 
20 question, both, either one of you a question about 
21 maybe we'll find out more later, but how this 
22 pertains or relates to the knowledge that maybe 
23 Officer Wilson would of had at the time? 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: You will hear some evidence 
25 about that.

2 MS. ALIZADEH: There will be, we have a 
3 lot of witnesses to call still. 
4 Okay. 
5 MS. ALIZADEH: A lot of these things, it 
6 is difficult for us to, if we were in a trial, you 
7 try to put things on in order that people can make 
8 sense of it. But in a trial you make an opening 
9 statement so you can outline for the jury what the 
10 evidence is going to be. 
11 But we are not doing that here, and so you 
12 all understand you are hearing things and not 
13 knowing what's left to come. 
14 There will be, I believe, other witnesses 
15 who talk about that, so we'll just have to wait and 
16 see how that testimony comes in. 
17 Will we hear 
18 testimony any of witnesses inside the store to the 
19 events that happened in the store? 
20 MS. ALIZADEH: Possibly. Sheila and I 
21 have not made out our list. Our intention is to 
22 call as many people as we can. Some people may not 
23 be cooperative. We will serve subpoenas on people 
24 who don't voluntarily agree to come in. 
25 I don't know how else to explain that

So tell us how you met Big Mike? 
I met Big Mike, I recently had, well, not 
4 recently, but I just moved in those apartments, I 
5 had me and my girlfriend, my daughter, we were 
6 staying in the apartment, two bedroom apartment, I 
7 had a roommate. I just moved over there. 
8 I only been staying in those 
9 apartments for about eight months. I met Big Mike 
10 around the fifth month that I was living there. I 
11 met him through a friend that I know from the area, 
12 neighborhood down the street where he lived. 
Q Okay. 13 
14 A So when he introduced Big Mike, they came 
15 to my apartment one day, they want to play video 
16 games, you know, relax and have conversation. And I 
17 didn't have a problem with that. 
18 So they came over, and when he came 
19 to my door, he was real quiet when he came in, you 
20 know, he was the biggest person in the room. So it 
21 struck me as kind of strange, I don't really be 
22 around people that I don't know. So I asked him a 
23 question, I was like, hey, how you doing. I live 
24 here, this is my house. 
25 And he spoke back to me, he said I'm

1 all right, you know. And he just kind of kept it to 
2 hisself. I felt that he was good, he was just a 
3 person that didn't speak a lot. So he was all right 
4 with me to be in my house. 
5 Q Did you socialize with him on a regular 
6 basis after that or how often would you say you was 
7 in his presence? 
8 A Like I said, it was my apartment, so you 
9 know, I had bills and things like that. I was 
10 working at the time of me first moving into the 
11 apartments. I recently lost my job around the sixth 
month, I met him in the fifth month, so now I'm on 
the verge of finding new work and finding a way to 
pay the bills. So I was not able to connect with 
him on a daily basis or even every other day because 
I'm trying to find work.

24 Northwinds and it was right behind Canfield. When I

14 Q Okay. Had you ever been to his 
15 grandmother's house? 
16 A One time, but I never met anyone in his 
17 family. At that time I think his grandmother was 
18 real strict on who she let inside her home. So at 
19 that time I didn't know them that well, so he was 
20 telling me that you should come around more, my 
21 granny, she will like you, you will be able to come 
22 in.

12 day. I start my morning, I wake up, I take a 
13 shower, and I ask my girl does she like breakfast, 
14 what would she like for breakfast. I head out to go 
15 get it. Upon getting breakfast I get me some 
16 Cigarillos. I smoke marijuana in my mornings when I 
17 start my day off, so I was going headed to the 
18 store. 
19 Q Now wait a minute, just stop here to now

2 was helping someone put some kids in the car, he was 
3 putting some kids in the car for his auntie, I 
4 believe it was. 
5 Q Okay. And what, did you go over to where 
6 he was or did he come to you? 
7 A Yeah, just coincidently the guy who I was 
8 going to is like a path is passing up the building 
9 where he is living in now. So I was going to pass 
10 the building whether he was outside or not, just 
11 coincidentally he was outside and he was alone at

1 enough to me if I saw him I would stop and speak to 
2 him. 
3 So I stopped and spoke to him. He 
4 asked me where I was headed to. I told him, I was 
5 going to get some rillos and get something to eat 
6 for me and my girl, I'm headed back to the house. 
7 He was like okay, well, I'll match you. I guess he 
8 had his own weed, so he said he would match me one. 
9 Matching is, if you don't know, is just someone I 
10 will roll the weed, he will roll the blunt, we both 
11 exchange blunts. 
12 Q In matching does that mean that one person 
13 has the weed and one person has the rillos? 
14 A One person has their weed and rillos, the 
15 other person has his weed and rillos and they smoke 
16 together, it is just smoking together basically. 
17 Q So he said he would match you? 
18 A Correct. 
19 Q And then what happened? 
20 A He stopped and talked to some construction 
21 workers. There was two construction workers that 
22 was doing work on the bottom floor at the time of 
23 his building. They was doing work on my building 
24 also, but they was doing work at his building and he 
25 had stopped and said something to them. I really

1 didn't hear, but I notice that the construction

6 for about one are two minutes.

8 saying? 
9 A No, I couldn't hear what they were saying. 
10 I wasn't really focusing on their conversation

But that changed? 
Yes, it changed. 
Tell us how? 
It changed. We started talking, our 
5 conversation was about sports, he was into clothes 
6 and fashion, our conversation was drifting from 
7 topic to topic, but really based on sports, design, 
8 girls or what our future plans was. 
9 He was just telling me he was about 
10 to go off to school or go to school. I was telling 
11 him about my past experience in school. I was in 
12 school before Lincoln University, when I graduated 
13 high school, I went straight to school. So I was 
14 telling him some challenges that he was going to 
15 face, even though he wasn't at a university, he was 
16 going to face some challenges. Basically our 
17 conversation was about future, future emphasis.

Q

It kind of took my mind off of going to 
20 the person in the complex because he didn't know the

22 the guy I was going to get the rillos from. When I 
23 told him I was going to get Cigarillos, he was like, 
24 I need one too. Let's walk to the store.

1 deep that I forgot that there was a person there 
2 that I was going to, so we ended up just walking to 
3 the store. 
4 Q Any idea, I know timing is difficult, but 
5 if you started out at seven-ish in the morning, any 
6 idea how long, how much time went by before you got 
7 to the market? 
8 A Before we got to the market, I mean, it 
9 wasn't really an hour, it wasn't that long, but our 
10 conversation because he had to go, I asked him could 
11 he go check on my friend that I knew ask him 
12 if he wanted to walk to the store with us. He said, 
13 yeah, he went up to go check on him. When he came 
14 back down, he told me that he was really sleepy, he 
15 didn't feel like it, he wanted to sleep in that 
16 morning. 
17 So that's basically what 30 minutes, 
18 I'm not real pressed on time, but it could have been 
19 more than an hour before we started walking. 
20 Q So from the time you left Canfield Green 
21 and then you saw Mike, Big Mike talked to the

A 
Q 
No, we went straight to the market. 
Market, okay. So tell us about the 
4 market, what happened at the market? 
5 A At the market, now, prior to walking to 
6 the store, never came up that he didn't have any 
7 money. I had money, I had money in my pocket. It 
8 never came up he didn't have any money or what we 
9 were going to do in the store because we already 
10 knew we was going to purchase Cigarillos, in my mind 
11 that's what we were going to do. 
12 It didn't strike me, I never thought 
13 that he didn't have any money because like I said, 
14 when I did see him the times that I see him, he 
15 dressed nice and next generation clothing, so it is 
16 kind of pricier, so I figure that he had money.

As he is talking to the male store clerk, 
6 the male store clerk ask him what does he want. Big 
7 Mike says in a very not, you know, threatening voice 
8 he just said, and while he was saying what he 
9 wanted, he said I want these box of Cigarillos. 
10 While he was saying it, he was leaning forward to 
11 grab them. 
Q Okay. 12 
13 A He leaned forward, but it wasn't a snatch 
14 and grab motion like he did it really quickly. He 
15 did it like, like he did it before I should say. 
16 Once he reached over the counter the first time, the 
17 store clerk, he was standing right in front of him, 
18 he never did anything, he didn't say anything, the 
19 first time, he didn't smack his hand down or 
20 anything like that. 
21 That was the time that he pulled back 
22 and he handed the box, it was a box of mini 
23 Cigarillos, 69 cent Cigarillos. It was just a box 
24 of them. He turned around and handed those to me.

1 A Now, at this time I still didn't think

3 saw people purchase a lot of Cigarillos at one time, 
4 a large amount. It is not that much 30 or $40, you 
5 can buy you a box. 
6 It wasn't until he went back the 
7 second time and grabbed a handful of the single 
8 Cigarillos. Now first he grabbed the box and the 
9 store clerk did nothing, this time he was going back 
10 to grab the single Cigarillos. As he was coming

Cigarillos, which made some of them fall. 
Mike turned to pick them up, and as he 
those up, he faced towards the door, that's 
knew okay, something is not right here. 
I didn't see, from where I was 
6 standing, I didn't see money get transferred to the 
7 store clerk and that's why I sat the box of 
8 Cigarillos back on the counter. I've been to the 
9 store a lot of times.

11 Big Mike say anything to the store clerk when the 
12 store clerk swatted at his hand?

Q 
A 
Okay. 
Because I'm standing behind him, but I'm 
19 trying to gather up, am I being pranked or is this 
20 something. Because I didn't hang out with Big Mike 
21 on a day-to-day basis, I didn't know how well his 
22 relationship was to the store clerk, so I didn't 
23 know was, you know, did he do this all the time or 
24 anything like that, I didn't know. I was trying to 
25 gather that in my head at the time.

1 Now, while all of this is going on, 
2 Big Mike is making his way towards the door. The 
3 store clerk had came around, now he came around his 
4 register and he's making his way to the door. He's 
5 not like running or anything like that, more a pace 
6 walking and when he got to the front door, he didn't 
7 get there yet because a man, like I said, there was 
8 another male customer in there at the time. He had 
9 just purchased something. As he's leaving out, he's 
10 kind of holding the door open like he's watching, 
11 but he's trying to get away at the same time, like 
12 he didn't have nothing to do with it, but he is 
13 watching. I see him holding the door open. 
14 As he let the door close, Big Mike 
15 was almost at the door, so he was going to put his 
16 hand on the door to, you know, to push the door 
17 open. 
18 By that time the store clerk had got 
19 around and he was almost in front of the door, he 
20 didn't get there right directly in front of the door 
21 so much as put his hand on the door. 
22 Big Mike, Big Mike thrushed the door 
23 open to where the store clerk, it slipped out of his 
24 hand, so the door flew open. And at that time I 
25 was, I knew, I saw what was going on, but I didn't

1 know it was going to happen that way. So I was 
2 trying to pull myself as far away from the initial 
3 contact with the store clerk as possible because I 
4 didn't know what was going on. 
5 So at that time when he slung the 
6 door open, I was making my way, I was trying to get 
7 around Big Mike and the store clerk to exit the 
8 store because I didn't want any part of it, I knew 
9 there was cameras in the store. 
10 When Big Mike tried to go out and 
11 thrush the door open and came out of the store 
12 clerk's hand. The store clerk then tried to grab 
13 Big Mike and Big Mike kind of reverses the grab and 
14 grab, like it was a very fast motion, but the store 
15 clerk never came off of neither one of his feet. He 
16 never fell on the floor or got punched or anything 
17 like that, it was a very fast motion, just a shove. 
18 Q So when this grabbing is occurring, is Big 
19 Mike saying anything?

1 time I heard the store clerk saying something, we 
2 were walking out of the store and I heard the store 
3 clerk say, I'm going to call the police. 
4 Q And did Big Mike say anything in response 
5 to that? 
6 A Just kept walking. 
7 Q Okay. What did you guys do then, did you 
8 go and get something to eat? 
9 A At that time eating and all of those other 
10 things that I had on my mind were left field. I had 
11 just witnessed something occur that I feel like if 
12 not, you know, I was there. So I walked in with 
13 him, I felt like I was an accomplice. 
14 I was trying to figure it out in my 
15 head at the time we were leaving out of the store 
16 like, all right, I didn't know this was going to 
17 happen. I didn't touch anything, but I did see what 
18 just happened and I know there was a crime. 
19 Q Did you all talk about it, did you and Big 
20 Mike talk about it?

1 didn't strike me as a person who would do anything 
2 like that. He never talked about any crimes or 
3 anything like that. And prior to that day, it 
4 shocked me a lot, it shocked me a lot. So I was 
5 asking him, I was like, you know hey, I don't do 
6 stuff like that. What's going on. 
7 And so much is giving me an answer as 
8 to why he did it was he was basically laughing it 
9 off, be cool, be calm, stuff like that laughing it 
10 off but in my head I'm like, I can't be calm, I 
11 can't be cool because I know what just happened and 
12 we were on camera.

16 Q 
Did you talk to him about being on camera? 
I never said that, but I knew we were on 
Did he appear as if he had, was 
17 intoxicated or impaired in any way at that time? 
18 A No, like I said, the conversation leading 
19 up to the store was a general conversation I would 
20 have with anybody any other day. There was nothing 
21 strange about the conversation. He didn't say any 
22 words that made me feel like you need to sit down or 
23 anything like that. Up until that point I thought 
24 he was mindful of everything that was going on at 
25 the time.

1 Q So when you first encountered him or first 
2 made contact with him that morning, you said you all 
3 had never smoked together between the time you 
4 caught up with him to the time you went to the 
5 store? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Did he seem like he had some marijuana or 
8 something before you saw him that morning? 
9 Basically what you know of him? 
10 A Yeah, based on what I saw of him that 
11 morning before we walked to the store, he didn't 
12 look like he smoked anything that morning or 
13 anything like that at that time.

15 West Florissant?

We are waking down West Florissant. 
On West Florissant? 
Now we are walking down West Florissant, 
19 from Ferguson Market to Canfield is actually like, 
20 walking is like a four minute, five minute walk, 
21 especially when you are having a conversation 
22 talking, could be longer, could be shorter, but in 
23 that timeframe of walking to Canfield, I saw a 
24 police cruiser coming down, coming down West 
25 Florissant. It was a Ferguson cruiser, it was a

1 truck. 
2 At that time in my head I was like, 
3 wow, he called the police. They came really 
4 quickly, I knew that they would probably come 
5 quickly. I was just, wow, we're really going to get 
6 locked up, this is going to happen. 
7 But when the police officer, you 
8 know, they passed us, the first car never stopped at 
9 the Ferguson Market. The first car stopped at 
10 McDonald's right next to the Ferguson Market and 
11 they kind of just sit on the lot. And that kind of 
12 struck me as odd. I was like, wow, maybe he didn't 
13 call the police at that time. Maybe he didn't call 
14 the police or they didn't get the dispatch call or 
15 anything like that because they drove past us and at 
16 no point in time, the shorts that I had on, I had on 
17 pajama shorts, I didn't have pockets on them. 
18 I was not able to grab Cigarillos out 
19 of Big Mike's hand to put in my pocket, he had 
20 pockets. He did not put the Cigarillos in his 
21 pocket. The Cigarillos now he has them in both 
22 hands, now he is spreading them evenly apart and we 
23 are walking down plain sight West Florissant to 
24 Canfield. 
25 Q You are not like running or hiding?

1 A Not running or not hiding, we are in plain 
2 sight walking down the sidewalk while we are on West 
3 Florissant and I see the police cruiser. 
4 Q You walk to West Florissant and then what 
5 is the street that takes you into Canfield 
6 Apartments? 
7 A Canfield Drive. 
8 Q Canfield Drive. So you walk up Canfield 
9 Drive? 
10 A Well, once we get to Canfield, I see 
11 another police cruiser pass us by. Now this one, I 
12 believe, in my mind I believe he was going to the 
13 store to check the car if the store clerk made the 
14 call. At that time I wasn't aware, but I heard him 
15 say as I was walking out the store that he was going 
16 to call the police. 
17 And seeing two police squad cars 
18 before we got to Canfield, it made me believe that 
19 he did call the police and if so, why didn't they 
20 pull up on us at that time. 
21 But we got to Canfield and now we're 
22 walking down Canfield, like I said, we wasn't 
23 running, we wasn't ducking behind bushes or anything 
24 like that.

4 you know, not that much traffic up and down Canfield 
5 to what is backed up two or three cars will pass you 
6 going both ways. 
7 Q This is a Saturday? 
8 A Yes. 
9 Q And according to the information, the 
10 records, it is somewhere around 11-ish or so, right 
11 around noon time that you guys were at that store? 
12 
13 
A According to the information, like I said. 
Q Would that sound reasonable to you if you 
14 heard that?

2 The conversation we was having at 
3 this point, we was talking the same, the 
4 conversation never changed about what we were 
5 talking about future goals and stuff like that, what 
6 we were planning on doing. 
7 And basically he was asking me 
8 questions on how did I transform to coming from 
9 where I was and getting on track and now I have my 
10 own apartment and stuff like that, I was just 
11 telling him a few things that I went through in my 
12 life that made me change and stuff like that. 
13 I knew he wasn't someone like me, I 
14 knew he didn't grow up where I grew up from, where 
15 there was a bunch of violent gangs and violent stuff 
16 occurring all the time. I knew that much about 
17 because I read from his demeanor he didn't come up 
18 that way. I'm telling him about my life story and 
19 how I come up from a bunch of tragedies. I went to 
20 school, I was still able to do things that I need to 
21 do in life. 
22 At that time he asked, at that time 
23 there was no cars, no traffic, no one was coming up 
24 or down Canfield Drive. We got in the middle of the 
25 street, got into the middle of the street. We're

1 walking in the middle, I'm in front of Big Mike and 
2 he's right behind me. He's real big so I know 
3 people can see him right above me. 
4 So we are walking on the street. At 
5 that time we are walking like 30 seconds, I'm not 
6 really on the time preferences, about 30 seconds and 
7 traffic started going, but no one blew their horns, 
8 no one made irregular turns to get around us like we 
9 were in the way and no one yelled out their windows, 
10 you guys are in the way, get out of the street, 
11 anything like that. Two or three cars had passed 
12 us. 
13 Q Let me ask you a question. Where were you 
14 guys headed at this point? 
15 A At this point we was headed back to my 
16 house or his house because where we were staying, 
17 like I said, we were staying directly apart from 
18 each other, but on opposite side of the streets. I 
19 lived on this side, my building was on this side and 
20 the building he was staying in at that time was on

10 say anything. I was the one that was talking when 
11 the police officer said get the F on the sidewalk. 
12 I told the police officer we was just a minute away 
13 from our destination, I live in Canfield and we'll 
14 be off the street closely. 
15 Now, at that time I was looking at 
16 the officer's face, but not really in his eyes. I 
17 really didn't look back up at Big Mike, he didn't 
18 say anything. I was the one talking to the officer 
19 and I wasn't loud with the officer or anything like

18 didn't hear his tires screech, the back of his

11 the time I believe he was talking to both of us when 
12 he said, what did you say? 
13 And Big Mike, in an instant, Big Mike 
14 was finished saying something, his door was thrust 
15 open, very complex, he thrust his door open real 
16 hard. We was so close to the door that it hit 
17 mostly Big Mike, but it hit me on my left side and 
18 it closed back on him, like real fast. Just the 
19 same speed, boom, boom, that fast. 
20 And at that time he never attempted 
21 to open the door again like to try to get back out, 
22 but his arm came out the window and that's the first 
23 initial contact that they had. The officer grabbed, 
24 he grabbed ahold of Big Mike's shirt around the neck 
25 area.

1 Q So did he grab his neck or his shirt 
2 around the neck area? 
3 A It was more of both because he had a real 
4 good grip on him. 
5 Q Was there any warning, did he just stuck 
6 his hand out and grab, does he say something, did he 
7 say anything? 
8 A No, ma'am, at this time when the door had 
9 closed back on him, he didn't say anything. His arm 
10 almost in an instant came out the window, his left 
11 arm, I remember it was his left arm, came out the 
12 window and touched Big Mike around his neck area and 
13 his throat. I watched his hands, you know, they 
14 really tightened up, so yeah, he had a good grip on 
15 it, that what's I saw first. 
16 Q Were you still right behind Big Mike when 
17 this occurred? 
18 A At this time I'm not behind him any more, 
19 we're side to side so I can see everything that is 
20 going on. I'm still in the windowed, I'm still 
21 right here standing in the same spot, I never moved. 
22 And at that time Big Mike, he still 
23 has the Cigarillos in both of his hands, divided 
24 evenly, he never put them down in his pocket or 
25 anything like that.

1 Now, from the beginning of the grab, 
2 it is a tug of war. Big Mike places his hands 
3 openly, one hand on top of the cruiser and the other 
4 hand more right up under the window, the side 
5 mirror. He's trying to pull off the officer's grip. 
6 Q How is he doing that with the Cigarillos 
7 in his hand? 
8 A He placed the Cigarillos on the car and 
9 his hands are on the car. He never dropped a single 
10 pack. He still has them in his hand not dropping 
11 them, but he's pulling away, but he still grab on. 
12 So he never could really get a good grip on the car, 
13 but he's really trying to pull away. 
Q Okay. 14 
15 A At this time the officer, I'm not hearing 
16 what the officer is saying, I'm not hearing what Big 
17 Mike is saying, so now I'm not in shock, but that's 
18 the beginning of my shock level. That's where I'm 
19 like, this doesn't happen every day, something is 
20 out of order here. 
21 They are talking to each other, they 
22 are yelling and cussing. And neither one of them 
23 can calm down, they both have angry faces on while 
24 they are talking. 
25 They both were very upset and they

1 couldn't calm do. There wasn't any wrestling or 
2 anything like that, punches were thrown. It was 
3 more a tug of war and it was very intense, very 
4 intense. 
5 Q Okay. And so please tell us what 
6 happened? 
7 A While the officer is grabbing ahold of Big 
8 Mike, he kind loses grip around his neck, that's how 
9 I knew he had a good grip. He never fully let Big 
10 Mike go, now he has a good grasp on his shirt. So 
11 now Big Mike's able to turn different angles while 
12 he is trying to pull away. 
13 And at a point he turned, now we are 
14 face-to-face, and he put his hands like, grab these, 
15 Bro. And in shock, I'm so not unconsciously, my 
16 hands open to where he could put the rillos in my 
17 hand, but I'm still standing in the same spot. I 
18 never said anything any more, I'm just standing in 
19 shock. I'm this close, I'm standing right here. 
20 I almost feel like someone needs to 
21 come out here and say something to either one of 
22 them to calm somebody down. 
23 At the time I couldn't open my mouth, 
24 I couldn't speak. I wanted to say could someone 
25 calm down. I could not speak at that time and the

1 Cigarillos were placed in my hand. 
2 At that time he turned back around, 
3 facing the officer now, and now he can get a good 
4 grip on the car. 
5 So now as he is pulling away, it is 
6 with more power, with more force. The officer is 
7 trying to pull him inside the vehicle through the 
8 window, like he's pulling him, but he's pulling 
9 away. The officer never attempted to open his door 
10 again after the first initially opening his door and 
11 close back on him. 
12 Now he's trying to pull him, he's 
13 pulling away.

Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Was he pulling him with both his hands? 
No. 
The officer is only using the left hand? 
The officer is only using his left arm and 
18 trying to pull Big Mike in and I could tell Big Mike 
19 was, he was getting the best of the officer because 
20 here was in a better position to pull away. He was 
21 outstanding and he was pulling off of something. 
22 The officer was using one hand, 
23 although he had a nice size, I really couldn't get 
24 the full body, but from his arm and when I seen his 
25 arm, he had nice size so where he was kind of

1 strong, he looked strong enough to pull, but not 
2 strong enough to fully pull hum all the way in the 
3 car. 
4 Q Was the car moving at all? 
5 A No, at this time it was parked, it was 
6 still there in the same spot he pulled up in, same 
7 angle he was in. 
8 And by this time there was cars 
9 behind and they could not get through because of how 
10 the officer had his vehicle or the cars couldn't get 
11 through the other way either east or west. So now 
12 we're just like three cars parked more towards the 
13 same direction the officer was going. 
14 
15 
Q 
A 
That would be west on Canfield Drive? 
On Canfield Drive. Now, in the midst of 
16 the tug of war, I never see Big Mike actually have 
17 his body inside the vehicle, like the officer never 
18 fully got him inside so much as he has torso or top 
19 area coming toward the window. 
20 Q Did you ever see Big Mike's hands inside 
21 the car? 
22 A No, ma'am, I never, I'm still standing 
23 there, more shocked than ever because I see it is 
24 escalating, I can see and hear the cuss words, I can 
25 see the frowns on their faces getting more intense.

1 the film we saw, he only had the Cigarillos in one 
2 hand. 
3 A Yes, when he initially grabbed out of the 
4 store, he had a lot of them in one hand when he 
5 grabbed them in the store. Once he got outside the 
6 store, that's when he divided them kind of and had 
7 both of his hands.

1 officer standing outside. He was more overpowering 
2 the officer and the officer couldn't get him to 
3 close to the car. 
4 So as he is pulling away, I can see 
5 his hand on front of the car, not both of his hands 
6 were on top. One hand was on top, the other hand 
7 was kind of by the side mirror on the officer's 
8 cruiser. So I can see his hands as he's pulling 
9 away, but then the officer, you know, there's a tug 
10 of war. He pulled him and then he pulled away. 
11 That begs another 
12 question. You said he was getting the best of the 
13 officer. And when Sheila asked you if the car was 
14 moving, not was it mobile, but was moving, like was 
15 it so much force that it was rocking or something? 
16 A I mean, the truck, yes, it was moving. 
17 Because you didn't say 
18 you could tell that Big Mike was getting the best of 
19 the officer? 
20 A Yes. 
21 If he is 300 pounds and 
22 6'3", there has to be movement of the car? 
23 A Yeah, because of the distance, or 
24 whatever, and he was standing, the car was moving,

10 somebody in the apartment complex?

A Yes, ma'am, correct.

16 Naturally you didn't get

18 were kind of diverted you said to the Ferguson

13 the store, now I'm more wanting to just get back to 
14 my daughter and my girl because I know the

18 eight months you said, right?

4 Okay, all right. With you 
5 being the older person, I think I heard in one of 
6 the DVDs that we saw or either in the transcript of 
7 that, you were basically kind of being a mentor to 
8 Mike; is that correct? 
9 A Yes, ma'am, correct. 
10 You saw that as an 
11 unofficial mentor? 
12 A That's correct. It wasn't just like that 
13 with Big Mike, it was other kids his age that would 
14 see me and they see how I look and they see me 
15 walking up and down the street. 
16 I have a dog, so me and my dog, I 
17 walk my dog a lot. I just live a peaceful lifestyle

20 see me how did you, what happened, how did you get

8 condition or the relationship between the community, 
9 the African-American community or community in that 
10 area and the Ferguson Police Department? 
11 A No, ma'am, to my knowledge, Big Mike was 
12 living in Ferguson a lot longer than I was. Like I 
13 said, his grandmother stayed in Northwinds, they 
14 still in Ferguson. He knew a lot of people that 
15 stayed in Ferguson. 
16 He was very popular, you know, with 
17 the kids, or people in the area. I was just the new

19 really didn't know people around or that much about 
20 Ferguson to give him knowledge about Ferguson and he 
21 stayed there a lot longer.

3 approximately how many feet, did you have a block to

16 did not obey that order to get out of the street at 
17 that time and onto the sidewalk?

20 didn't feel like I was rude. I knew by law that we 
21 really wasn't committing a crime at the time because 
22 there was no traffic flow and no one was, you know,

4 thinking in my mind, we are just walking down the

12 So at that time if the officer didn't 
13 know and I feel that he didn't know about the store 
14 because Big Mike still did have the Cigarillos in 
15 his hands in plain sight when the officer pulled up 
16 on us. He was just saying get on the sidewalk. 
17 Once I responded to him telling him we was a minute 
18 away from the destination, I felt like that we were 
19 not committing a crime, we were having our 
20 conversation, we was just walking. 
21 At that time the officer really 
22 didn't look like, you know, he was mad or he was 
23 telling us that we was committing a crime, he was 
24 just saying get on the sidewalk. We was basically 
25 okay, we will be out of the street in a minute.

1 Did you, I mean, did the 
2 thought ever come to your mind at that point in time 
3 that maybe he was doing it for public safety to 
4 avoid you being struck by a vehicle in the street or 
5 anything of that nature, maybe for your own safety? 
6 A At the time, no, I was not thinking that, 
7 but I could see how that would come into effect. At 
8 the time I was not thinking we was in harm's way or 
9 anything like that. Like I said, cars had passed us 
10 before the police got on the side of us, no one 
11 made, you know, any remarks saying, hey, you guys 
12 are in our way or blowing their horn or anything 
13 like that. So at the time I didn't feel like we 
14 were in harms way. 
15 Earlier you spoke about 
16 the construction worker, you did not speak to the 
17 construction worker, you did not talk to them? 
18 A No, I didn't say anything so much as just 
19 stand there. I honestly didn't believe the 
20 construction worker would give a conversation 
21 because they were working at the time. 
22 Okay. 
23 A I was just standing there. 
24 Could you hear them 
25 talking?

1 A Not so much as, hey, when the construction 
2 worker spoke back, I kind of bowed out of their 
3 conversation. I didn't hear what they were saying 
4 to one another. 
5 You didn't hear him 
6 talking about getting high and something? 
7 A At first I heard because that's what I was 
8 initially going to do. So I heard him bring up 
9 smoking or anything like that, but I couldn't get 
10 detailed on what exactly was said between him and 
11 the construction worker. I couldn't really factor 
12 in exactly what they were both saying. 
13 Where was the 
14 construction worker on your way back, they were 
15 gone? 
A We did not get there. 
You didn't get that far? 
A We didn't get that far. 
You mentioned, you said 
it was almost, you didn't know if you were being 
pun ked because it was almost like he had done it 
before. Do you think it is possible he could have 
done it before, do you think it is possible? I

1 if it is possible that he would do it at another 
2 store or anything like that. All I can say is how I 
3 felt at that time when I did see that because I 
4 never seen it before like that or the store clerk 
5 react that way or that slow. 
6 Yes, it was like he knew the people 
7 like he had been in that store before, like he knew 
8 them, that store before and he knew things like that 
9 in that store. 
10 It was not like he had 
11 stolen before or he was just familiar? 
12 A Familiar with the store to where he could 
13 just pick up things and just pay for however he 
14 pleases. 
15 I'm going to kind of ask 
16 you the same thing that he asked you. You said you 
17 didn't feel like you were doing anything wrong, but 
18 in the manner that the police spoke to you --
19 MS. WHIRLEY: Speak up a little bit for 
20 us. 
21 In the manner that he 
22 said get the fuck in, on the sidewalk. 
23 
24

Why were you not even on 
25 the sidewalk? It was not safe, is there a reason

1 why you didn't take advantage of the sidewalk, why 
2 you didn't do that? 
3 A It wasn't a reason that I wasn't on the 
4 sidewalk, it was more just a decision that we made. 
5 When we get down there or anything like that, but 
6 the initial, the reason we didn't follow the 
7 complaint, like I said, Big Mike at this time never 
8 said anything. 
9 Okay. 
10 A It was more like a chastisement than you 
11 are breaking law or you are committing a crime or 
12 you might bring harm to yourself. 
13 If those were represented in the way 
14 he came off to us when he first said it, then maybe, 
15 okay, you know what, we'll get on the sidewalk. 
16 Because of the way he said it and the manner that he 
17 said it, it was more like we're not your kids, we're 
18 not doing anything legally wrong, just walking down 
19 the street even though it could be considered a 
20 crime jaywalking, but we are just walking in the 
21 street, we are not committing any crime or bringing 
22 harm to anyone. 
23 My last question right 
24 now. When the police, you said that the police 
25 passed you?

15 it was a truck, not a car. Like I said, they didn't

3 A Correct. 
4 And you couldn't go 
5 anywhere 
6 A Yeah, at that point when he backed up on 
7 us, I stopped. 
8 
9 A 
Okay. 
Because I felt that he had something else 
10 to say and I didn't want to make myself look guilty 
11 by running away or being startled and, you know, 
12 making a quick reaction, so I just stood there and 
13 complied with the officer even though he never said 
14 freeze or hold when he pulled back. I felt I will 
15 just stand still and see what he asked. 
16 (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 15 
17 marked for identification.) 
18 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So at no time when the 
19 officer pulled back, we have brought a map that's

21 hopefully help you kind of illustrate where you guys

1 said, he never questioned you about that store 
2 incident? 
3 A No, ma'am. 
4 Q He never gave you any other directions 
5 then get out of the street or get on the sidewalk? 
6 A After he initially said get on the 
7 sidewalk, he never even brought the sidewalk 
8 situation back up. He never brought the store up 
9 after he gave his first statement about getting on 
10 the sidewalk and I told him exactly how I said we 
11 are a minute away from our destination. We will be 
12 out of the street shortly. After he pulled back, 
13 there was no more sidewalk talk, it was nothing, it 
14 was just anger.

19 everyone see this map? You had a question? 
20 A couple 
21 questions. I want to keep it before we move on. 
22 When you went into the market, you talked about 
23 payment, did you have money in your hands? I know 
24 you didn't have any pockets, I'm trying to figure 
25 out where you had your money?

1 A I had my money in my shoe at the time, 
2 yes, I had my money in my shoe. 
3 When you left the store, I 
4 thought it was strange you guys stuck together. You 
5 didn't seem concerned, then kind of something bad 
6 was there, then you kind of stuck with Mike, kind of 
7 walk down the street, see the cops coming knowing 
8 they might be coming for me, I would expect probably 
9 more hide behind the bush, get back in place. What 
10 is the reason you walked down the street waiting for 
11 the cops to come get you? 
12 A Like I said, that was in my mind at the 
13 time, we're not running, there is nothing really to 
14 hide behind on West Florissant. We could have run 
15 behind the stores, we still had to get out in the 
16 open eventually to get down Canfield. In the mind 
17 walking from Ferguson Market to Canfield, we're 
18 never making it to Canfield. We're never making it 
19 to Canfield how far this store is, to how many 
20 police cars we see on a day, you know, that's just 
21 in the area, we'll never make it to Canfield. 
22 You know, just seems 
23 strange to be in the middle of the street, you think 
24 on the sidewalk to kind of avoid being noticed.

1 everything that is going on and why he didn't put 
2 the Cigarillos in his pocket. He still had them in 
3 his hand the whole time leaving out the store, all 
4 the way walking down Canfield Drive. 
5 When the police officer 
6 backed up at you, obviously, very aggressive. You 
7 think he intended to hit you, you think it was a 
8 miscalculation on the part of his judgment what he 
9 thinks, I shouldn't ask it that way, but I'm just 
10 trying to, I mean, that's pretty aggressive if you 
11 felt like you had to literally get out of the way to 
12 avoid him hitting you, if you felt that way? 
13 A Yes, correct. It was very aggressive and 
14 fast the way he pulled back, but because we heard 
15 the tires, we was able to step back almost a second 
16 before the truck, the back of the rear of it kind of 
17 hit us, so it didn't hit us, but the way his car was 
18 angled, it very well could have hit both of us. 
19 Just a 
20 quick follow-up question. Is it typical for you to 
21 walk down the middle of the street when you went to 
22 the market or walk around the neighborhood. 
23 A No, sir. I walked in the middle of the 
24 street before, but it is not like I just wake up in 
25 the morning, hey, we are going to walk in the middle

1 of the street. It is something you do, you are 
2 crossing the street and try to stay a little longer 
3 or you just walking down the sidewalk. It wasn't 
4 planned to walk in the street. 
5 Typically you would be on 
6 the sidewalk? 
7 A Correct. 
8 In my mind an act of 
9 defiance going down the middle of the street 
10 expecting cars to go around you and, you know, pay 
11 attention to you. If I see somebody in the middle 
12 of the street I'd be concerned about hitting them 
13 and really slowing down and moving over. 
14 A Yeah, that's correct. 
15 I would interpret that 
16 they are being defiant to show strength or 
17 something. 
18 A Correct, walking down the middle of the 
19 street could, you know, cause harm if someone had 
20 to, but like I said, walking down the middle of the 
21 street we saw two, three, maybe even four cars pass 
22 us and no one blew their horn, no one even stopped 
23 or slowed down. They kept the same speed and just 
24 rolled right passed us.

3 he was standing with a friend, Building Number

5 also. 
6 That morning when I came out, I could

8 someone put kids in the car.

10 Q 
The guy who I was going to --

11 When you indicate where Big Mike is, could you put

20 was staying a little further back in Northwinds. At 
21 the time of the incident he was staying here at the 
22 time, something was going on with his grandmother, 
23 he had to move out, and he was staying with a 
24 friend.

1 down in the parking lot area. Now the guy I was 
2 going to go to for the Cigarillos, stayed in this 
3 building right here Number Like I said, 
4 regardless whether I saw him or not, I was passing 
5 this building, that's the way I walk through to go 
6 to the guy. 
7 When I saw him, we had our words, 
8 we're going to match, now we are walking up. 
9 Now this is where we are going 
10 towards the store, going up Canfield. Now back to 
11 the part where the officer pulled up on us. 
12 One is the leasing office, the first 
13 building. We were pretty much, we didn't get on 
14 into the street until we were like right before the 
15 leasing office, so it had to be right here where we 
16 initially just crossed over into the street. 
17 Now, when the street, the officer 
18 doesn't pull up on us until about right here is 
19 where the police officer first really pulled up on 
20 the side of us. 
21 After he initially said get on the 
22 sidewalk, we got to about, I say we wasn't really 
23 that far away from him, we got to about right here.

25 still, you said I don't have, I'm almost at my

1 destination, you keep walking east? 
2 A Yes, we were still walking, but eventually 
3 I figure we were going to get out of the street. 
4 So you were 
5 right there at Copper Creek Road and he said get the 
6 F on the sidewalk? 
7 A Yes. 
8 You said not but a 
9 minute, you kept walking, you didn't hesitate, you 
10 didn't even do anything except we are almost home? 
11 A Yes, that is what I told the officer. We 
12 are a minute away from our destination, I'll be out 
13 of the street shortly. At this time Big Mike said 
14 nothing, no words were out of his mouth towards the 
15 officer.

19 almost at your destination, this goes to one of the

22 is where the officer stopped us. He asked us to get

2 actually see both our buildings from standing right 
3 there, there is no real big trees or anything, they 
4 were actually cutting trees down in the

MS. WHIRLEY: That's better. 
Like one car. It had to be a second car 
16 and third car would be like right behind. 
17 MS. ALIZADEH: And Dorian, all three of 
18 those cars were going towards West Florissant?

20 
A Yes, ma'am, correct. 
MS. ALIZADEH: They were on the right side 
21 of the street? 
22

Now, like I said, I don't know how 
24 far we got along, but because of how the officer 
25 pulled reverse on us, now his cruiser was more like

1 on both sides. I'll put another rectangle, but his 
2 rear was more on the side where he was coming from 
3 and kind of like, the beginning of his front was on 
4 the other side. Either way cars couldn't come this 
5 way or go the other way. They were stuck, and at 
6 that moment that's when these three cars were 
7 standing right there. And like I said, me and Big 
8 Mike, we are standing on this side of the police 
9 cruiser car. 
10 Now, when he pulls up on us and he 
11 said, what did you say? I could tell that he's mad 
12 then, that's when he tried to open his door. Like I 
13 said, the way I was standing on the side of Big Mike 
14 when he opened his door, we was so close to his door 
15 that it hit us, but more so it hit Big Mike, only 
16 like a little portion of me, maybe the end of the 
17 door, it didn't really hurt me or anything like 
18 that, but it struck us and it closed back on the 
19 officer. 
20 At that time is when his arm came out 
21 the window and he grabbed onto Big Mike.

23 
Q 
A 
(By Ms. Whirley) Okay. 
Any other questions or should I continue?

25 did you say that the door hit you?

1 A The door hit me on my left side, left arm,

3 takes more of the door than me, but just a piece of

8 the store clerk made a move like he was going 
9 towards, like I said, the first time before the 
10 store clerk actually tried to grab for Big Mike 
11 because the first initial grab the store clerk just 
12 grabbed the door and Big Mike just pushed the door. 
13 Now, the store clerk made another 
14 step like he was trying to grab for Big Mike and 
15 that's when it was like a real --

MS. ALIZADEH: Like a push away? 
Fast push away, and I don't know if the 
18 store clerk was going to walk back on or anything,

20 stared at him. 
21 MS. ALIZADEH: And that was threatening, 
22 he was threatening, don't you think, he is 6 foot 
23 5 inches tall?

25 than me, shorter than me, you are right.

16 had to come back to you and say what did you say?

18 thinking, no one said anything, but I didn't say 
19 that to the officer because I didn't know what he 
20 was feeling at the time, the way he pulled a reverse 
21 on us, I was let me stand fast and see what he is 
22 going to say. That's why I basically was standing

1 cars stopped us or said hey, did you just come out 
2 of that store or anything like that. 
3 So in my mind at the time they were 
4 unaware or the store clerk never made the call 
5 because before we saw Darren Wilson, we saw two more 
6 police cars. He was the third police car we saw and 
7 he was the first one that stopped us. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: So you guys thought, or at 
9 least you thought you were in the clear that this 
10 officer wasn't talking to you about the Cigarillos.

14 thinking.

20 his mind. I can't think what he's thinking at the

22 before, not for anything like that, jail is not for 
23 nobody. Nobody should ever want to go to jail. So

10 before, I know there is a way that they stop or pull 
11 up on people, suspects for committing crimes. 
12 So exactly what I said, didn't feel 
13 like he was stopping us or telling us anything like 
14 we were committing a crime so much as chastising 
15 from a father to a son, like you are doing some 
16 wrong. Hey, put that down or don't touch that, it 
17 came off like that, that's how he said it.

3 When I saw that he wasn't, I didn't

14 looking directly at me, I'm looking at her 
15 face-to-face and she sees me actually put the box of 
16 Cigarillos back and I step back. 
17 Because they are kind of in front of 
18 the door so I really can't get through, like walking 
19 straight. So I have to kind of side step them. The 
20 store clerk, as he walked past me, he never tried to 
21 grab me, hey, you with him, he never did anything 
22 like that. So I felt like, you know what, he saw me 
23 put those back, he saw that my intentions were not 
24 to steal from him, so that's why I believe he didn't

2 When the police 
3 officer backed up and almost ran over you, let's 
4 say, and you guys were facing his window, when he 
5 opened his door, what is your sense of what he was 
6 trying to do when he was opening your door, do you 
7 think he was intentionally trying to hit you with 
8 the door or was he potentially trying to get out of 
9 the car very quickly? 
10 A That I can't speculate on. Again, I 
11 cannot speculate what is in someone's mind or what 
12 their agenda is going to be, but the force that he 
13 used and the power behind it, I believe it was 
14 unnecessary. He could of, and the way he backed up, 
15 if he would have backed up straight back, he would 
16 have been able to open his door, step out of his car 
17 perfectly. But because of the angle where he 
18 reversed and how close we were and how fast he did 
19 it, it happened real fast. Everything happened

1 A I don't think that it is possible not to 
2 see someone. You have a couple of mirrors attached 
3 to your car as you are backing up, I'm sure, I pray, 
4 I hope he was using his mirror and not intentionally 
5 trying to strike us. But like I said, I can't 
6 speculate what he was doing, I know that he was very 
7 forceful and powerful. 
8 MS. ALIZADEH: But Dorian, you said you 
9 guys had to kind of jump out of the way? 
10 A We definitely had to step back, not so 
11 much as a big leap to where, you know, oh. It was 
12 more of a step back real fast because of the rear 
13 end, you know, it wouldn't have, the whole back of 
14 the car wouldn't have hit us, it would have been 
15 like a corner of the side of the rear because of how 
16 he was turning his vehicle, it would have struck one 
17 of us, if it would have hit him, it would have fell 
18 into me, but if it would have hit me, I would have 
19 fell onto the ground. 
20 It seem likely 
21 to pull up next to you, you had the first encounter, 
22 he continued down west, probably, potentially looks 
23 in the mirror, sees you have not adjusted your path.

1 you aren't doing what he asked for, backs up, not 
2 only does he back up to stay straight, he backs up 
3 and puts his rear end across that center line, 
4 therefore, blocking your path. You can no longer 
5 walk down the center line any more, he is going to 
6 take that away. And possibly when he is asking you 
7 what did you say, I had a feeling he may be 
8 referring back to the first conversation we had and 
9 he is wondering, what did you say? Didn't you tell 
10 me you were going to get out of the street? 
11 Again, I'm assuming different things in 
12 there, but it may not have been a secondary 
13 conversation that he's referring to, what did you 
14 say when I drove away or when I was coming back, he 
15 very well could have been referring to the very 
16 first conversation, he's wondering why you are still 
17 in the street? 
18 A I can see where you are saying, he maybe 
19 didn't hear exactly what I was saying to him or 
20 something like that. I never said that it right 
21 away, officer, we get right on the sidewalk. So I 
22 could see why he would be like, they're not getting

1 A Big Mike and Darren Wilson, the officer, 
2 they are doing their tug of war. He passed me off 
3 the Cigarillos. Now he's back, at no point in time 
4 did I begin to move away, I stood in the same 
5 position, same spot. I'm still in the driver window 
6 of the officer the whole time they are doing their 
7 tug of war, so I can see both of them. I'm going 
8 back and forth looking at both of their faces. 
9 I'm hearing cuss words from both of 
10 them, but I don't really hear the officer saying, 
11 you know, stop or get down on the ground. 
12 I really like, I'm shocked, the shock 
13 level I'm going through right now is continuously 
14 building. So now it is more and more stuff, I'm 
15 trying to comprehend that it is not, it shouldn't be 
16 happening, that I know shouldn't be happening. They 
17 are pulling back and forth. At this time I heard 
18 the officer says, I'll shoot. This is the first he 
19 says, I'll shoot. 
20 At that time I was looking at Big 
21 Mike when he said I'll shoot. In my mind taser, I 
22 see people get tased before and it looks like it 
23 hurts a lot. 
24 Q Let me stop you a minute. So the first 
25 time the officer says, I'll shoot, Big Mike's hands

He's given you the Cigarillos? 
Yes. 
No shots have been fired yet? 
Not at the moment, no. 
Okay. So do you know where his hands are 
8 when the officer is saying, I'll shoot? 
9 A I can still see both Darren Wilson's hand 
10 and Big Mike's hands. 
11 
12 
Q 
A 
Tell us about it? 
Big Mike's left hand was still on like 
13 right above the side mirror, right up under that, 
14 right up under the side mirror. His other arm now 
15 because of the tug of war pull, the officer's grip 
16 come up, from up on his neck, to the shirt collar, 
17 to the shoulder, to basically he never let go. Now 
18 he has Big Mike. Big Mike's left arm is on the car 
19 pulling away still, and he's trying to pull away 
20 because now he basically just has his arm. 
21 
22 
Q 
A 
So the officer has his right arm? 
Yes, with the officer's left arm, he's out 
23 the window grabbing Big Mike's right arm. 
24 Q Okay. So he has Big Mike's right arm, 
25 does he pull it inside the car?

1 A I really, from the time of everything 
2 happening and once he said, I'll shoot, now my focus 
3 has switched and locked on the officer and say what 
4 he is saying he's going to shoot because in my mind 
5 I assume it is a taser. If it was going to be a 
6 taser, no matter who was in the wrong or who was in 
7 the right, if I would have saw that taser, I would 
8 have immediately told my friend Big Mike, look, just 
9 stop, stop moving, stop pulling away, just stop. 
10 But because I saw the gun and the 
11 barrel, I've been shot before. It is the worse pain 
12 I can ever imagine, it does not feel good, because I 
13 saw the barrel, I went into a deeper shock. 
14 Q You didn't think everybody should just 
15 stop when you saw the gun? 
16 A I was praying, I was, I'm in such shock 
17 right now and firm, because when the officer pulled 
18 up and that's why I was trying to make clear people 
19 were, he's a witness, key witness. I was so 
20 victimized that people don't even understand. 
21 There was a witness standing on their 
22 balcony, a witness drive by in her car, me being 
23 right there in the moment, I felt victimized because 
24 I felt so afraid that I couldn't talk. 
25 I couldn't say what was on my mind

1 because I'm so afraid of, I couldn't calm it down. 
2 I don't have the power to calm down the police 
3 officer and obviously Big Mike is bigger than me. 
4 Q Let's just go back. I understand what you 
5 are saying about seeing the shooting like that, but 
6 when Big Mike's right hand or arm is being pulled 
7 into the car, I don't know if you said that or not, 
8 you said that the officer had his right hand with 
9 his, the officer's left hand had Big Mike's right 
10 arm? 
11 
12 
A 
Q 
Correct. 
Where is it, did you see it or not, where 
13 his right, where Big Mike's right hand was? 
14 A I didn't see Big Mike's right hand because 
15 the officer had it, but it was up, so it may have 
16 been times when the officer could have pulled his 
17 right, because his left hand never removed off the 
18 officer's car. 
19 So there could have been times when 
20 the officer pulled him, but like I said, because of 
21 the position how Big Mike has on the officer, 
22 officer never got out of the car, he is still 
23 sitting down. He has a better way of pulling with 
24 more force, so he is just pulling. I can see more 
25 of the officer's arm out the window than his arm in

1 the window. 
2 Q From your vantage point, you can tell if 
3 Big Mike's hand ever went inside the officer's car? 
4 A No, because at the point, I'm back and 
5 forth, but when, I'll shoot, my eyes locked on the 
6 officer. 
7 Q So where was, where were the hands, I'm 
8 interested in the hands and the arms? 
9 A At that point when the officer said I'll 
10 shoot, now is like Big Mike, this hand is not on the 
11 car any more. 
12 
13 
Q 
A 
That's the left hand? 
The left arm is not on the car any more, 
14 the officer still has the right arm, but he's not 
15 inside the car. And when I look up and see the 
16 officer, the officer has his gun pointed, his left 
17 arm grabbed, he has his gun pointed aimed at Big 
18 Mike. 
19 In my mind it was probably aimed at 
20 both of us, but I assumed he wasn't directly just 
21 trying to go for Big Mike. He had his gun pointed 
22 towards us. I'm still standing in the doorway and 
23 at the time he said I'll shoot. He was going to say 
24 it again, I'll shoot and almost, he didn't get to 
25 finish his sentence, the gun went off.

1 Q At the time that the gun went off, where 
2 were the hands of Big Mike? 
3 A The left arm was down at his side. He was 
4 standing straight up, I was standing right on the 
5 side of him. The right arm was still up in the air 
6 while the officer, but still pulling, but it is not 
7 like he got any, pulling off the car, he is still 
8 pulling the officer. 
9 At this time, like I said, I see more 
10 of the officer's arm outside the car than Big Mike's 
11 arm inside the car, so he has a better position to 
12 pull away from, the officer was sitting down.

1 shoot, do you know if the gun was inside the car or 
2 outside the car. 
3 A The gun definitely was inside the car when 
4 he fired the shot. How me and Big Mike was 
5 standing, we were standing straight up, so we 
6 definitely was outside the vehicle. The bullet came 
7 outside the car and struck him. He was never inside 
8 the car and got struck, he was outside the car when 
9 the first shot went off. The officer was inside the 
10 car, so the gun was inside the car, but when he shot 
11 the gun, bullet traveled outside his car and struck 
12 Big Mike in the chest, or I seen blood coming from.

1 where the officer had a good pull and his arm would 
2 get in there, but majority of the time the officer 
3 really didn't have that much power because of the 
4 position that they both had. I'm not saying that he 
5 was stronger than the officer, but because the 
6 officer was sitting down in his car and Big Mike was 
7 standing up and he had better, more strength in 
8 pulling from the officer. 
9 
10 
Q

Right, can you go ahead?

12 the gun was already out drawn.

Q 
A 
How about touching the officer?

17 physically striking the officer, no, I didn't see.

2 directly in the doorway with him the whole time 
3 pulling away, he never swung his left arm at all or 
4 never put the left arm inside the window, anything

14 tell, you couldn't really see him, the officer, you 
15 said you couldn't tell what color hair he had, you 
16 couldn't see what kind of build he was, but because 
17 of his arm, you could tell that he was a certain, 
18 you could assume that he was a certain build. If 
19 you couldn't see the officer inside the car, is it 
20 possible that you couldn't have seen Big Mike's arm 
21 go into the car as well. 
22 A I was going to say on that, the way they 
23 ask that question, they was basically asking for a

4 You're not going to have that much 
5 ease with just, hey, get over here in this window. 
6 No, he's big, he's standing up, and the officer's 
7 gun is on his right side, I believe, because that's 
8 where he draw from with his right arm. In order for 
9 Big Mike to have touched the gun, it is almost like 
10 his whole top half of his body had to be inside the 
11 vehicle, and that never happened. 
12 His arm, yes, but like I said, the

18 had fallen over his shirt would have ripped. 
19 A I understand that, that would almost be 
20 believable if the officer was somebody of my size. 
21 If the officer was a small person, Darren Wilson 
22 didn't look small from his arm and from his, like I 
23 said, I saw his top part. He never got out of the 
24 car for me to see his full body size. I could tell 
25 he wasn't a small officer. It wasn't like he could

MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
He wasn't so much bigger than me like Big 
22 Mike, but he was bigger than me. You can tell he 
23 was a full grown man, he was a grown man. He didn't 
24 look like he was fat, he looked like he was a little 
25 muscle, like a little training on him. He looked

2 I didn't see where he was very weaker 
3 than Big Mike, just so much as he had a bad position 
4 sitting down not even getting out of the car, again, 
5 to even confront. Just basically trying to, like he 
6 was trying to pick up a kid or something like that. 
7 It is still the whole ordeal more still looking like 
8 chastisement from a father to a son type of deal. 
9 MS. WHIRLEY: Number 1? 
10 Yeah, 
11 Just take a couple steps back, I'm trying to trace 
12 how this began. Again, he puts it in reverse, what 
13 did you say, from your point of view or perspective, 
14 are you saying that Officer Darren is the aggressor 
15 in this situation in regards to making that first 
16 grab or whatever that is first? 
17 A Correct, yes, I am. He was the aggressor 
18 by initially just the way he reversed and opened his 
19 door and the grab, it was overaggressive. I felt 
20 like it wasn't needed. 
21 If it was just regular backing up and 
22 just gently getting out of his car, we had no reason 
23 why we wasn't running no time before then, so we had 
24 no reason to run from him if he would have did it 
25 right if he was, you know, answering to a distress

2 have definitely locked both of us up at the time, 
3 but like I said, he never said anything about the 
4 store, he never got out of the car or anything like 
5 that, it was all aggressive.

The police officer, like I said, he had a 
20 short sleeve shirt on, yes. I seen his arm, his 
21 forearm, yeah, he had short sleeve shirt on. 
22 Q So you told us the position of the hand 
23 when the gun goes off the first shot inside the car, 
24 he's in the car, the shot you said went out of the

3 A When the first shot went off, we were so 
4 close and ringing, I've been shot before so 
5 instantly everything, emotions that I had, like I've 
6 been shot three or four years ago, so everything is 
7 still fresh. With guns, I really dislike them loud 
8 bangs. 
9 At the time and seeing the fire come 
10 out of the gun and shot go off, when I see Big Mike, 
11 I see the blood come down his, where the officer had 
12 his right side. I'm on his right side, I see the 
13 blood come down. 
14 I never looked at myself because I 
15 was so afraid I was like, oh, I saw him. My eyes 
16 got big, he didn't say anything after that. He kind 
17 of looked at my face and saw my eyes and at that 
18 time, that was when the officer let go and we were 
19 both able to run. That's when I turn and run. He

1 that time now I'm just, I'm really afraid, I'm 
2 really afraid. I don't know if the officer's coming 
3 towards Big Mike or just towards both of us. Right 
4 now I'm just so afraid that the time I get past the 
5 first vehicle, I was in front of Big Mike when we 
6 was walking. When I took off running, I was still 
7 in front of him. 
8 When I got to the first vehicle, 
9 which was like a Sunfire or gray Sunfire, so very 
10 small vehicle. The officer was not yet out of his 
11 car, he was still in his car because I was able to 
12 run to the car and like stand, not squatting real 
13 low, but I was standing behind the car, the Sunfire, 
14 but I know he was able to still see the back of my 
15 neck and hair and all of those things. 
16 When Big Mike ran past me, he saw me, 
17 he looked directly at me he said, keep running, Bro. 
18 And at that time is when I kind of hear the door 
19 opening, I figure the officer is getting out of his 
20 car now, but before then, like I said, the officer 
21 was still in his car, I was able to run, squat 
22 behind the first car. 
23 Big Mike ran, he was right behind me. 
24 He looked directly in my eyes and said, keep 
25 running, Bro. That's when I knew that I was still

1 in plain sight. Now, the tension of me, I'm so 
2 afraid that I can't move any more, so I'm just 
3 standing there behind the first car now. 
4 There is people in this car. Now 
5 there is people coming outside the house because 
6 they heard the first shot, there is not that many 
7 people. As Big Mike run past me and sees me, he 
8 keeps going. He makes it past the second car, once 
9 he gets to the second car, I can feel, I'm not 
10 looking around me because I'm so scared. I'm just 
11 standing there and I can feel someone approaching, 
12 so I kind of give a glance over to my right and it 
13 is the officer now, he's walking, he's walking, but 
14 he is kind of fast walking. He's not running or 
15 anything like that, but he has his weapon drawn. 
Q Just like you are doing now? 16 
17 A Yes, in this manner, his weapon is drawn 
18 and he's walking in at fast manner. He's not saying 
19 anything, he's not saying freeze, he's not saying 
20 anything at this time while still just 
concentrating, he is walking. 21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
As I see him, I'm in plain sight, 
Mike was able to see me. He ran past me, keep 
running. I'm so scared, I cannot move my feet. 
And I watch the officer walk past,

1 never even looked at me. He just kept walking past 
2 and I'm watching him and I'm in awe. I'm like okay, 
3 is he looking for us or is he going after him, but 
4 everything is in my head is just racing real fast 
5 because of the gunshot and I'm hyperventilating, my 
6 heart is pounding. 
7 After he walked past me, I kind of 
8 stand up more. I'm trying to ask the people in the 
9 first car, could I please just let me in the 
10 vehicle, I stay in the same complex. You can just 
11 drop me off. They said no, and they pulled off on 
12 the sidewalk. 
13 
14 
Q 
A 
Where did they pull to? 
The first car? They didn't drive through 
15 the driveway, they pulled on the sidewalk to drive 
16 past the police officer. Once they pulled off, I 
17 was even more visible now. I'm standing straight, 
18 the officer's back is towards me, Big Mike's back is 
19 towards me and the officer because he is running 
20 away. 
21 I'm watching the officer, he's 
22 walking and Big Mike gets past the third car, the 
23 final car before the second shot was fired. It was 
24 the second shot fired, pow, the officer shot. I 
25 don't know if it hit, I wasn't that close to see

1 that it struck Big Mike, but the manner that he 
2 jerked and just stopped in his track, I sense that 
3 he was hit again. 
4 The first time I definitely knew, I 
5 definitely saw him get shot the first time, he had 
6 been struck one time already. 
7 The second time he shot, I didn't 
8 know if it hit him or not, but he kind of jerked and 
9 that's when he stopped running. He just kind of 
10 stopped and turned around at the officer. And now 
11 he's face-to-face with the officer, but not so 
12 close. 
13 Now, Big Mike is probably, he's not 
14 fully at the driveway, but he gets probably to the 
15 curb of the driveway when the second shot, and now 
16 at the second shot, the officer, I'll just put DW, 
17 he's passing the third vehicle.

22 because like I said, I was trying to talk to the

1 up and I was still in shock and now I'm just 
2 watching the officer, you know, pace towards Big 
3 Mike. I see him fire the second shot, I see Big 
4 Mike turn around and face the officer. And now the 
5 officer is past the last car and Big Mike is off the 
6 sidewalk now more in the street. 
7 Q What is Big Mike doing? 
8 A At that time Big Mike's hands was up, but 
9 not so much up in the air because he had been struck 
10 already in this region somewhere on this. It was 
11 like this hands is up and this hand is kind of like 
12 down sort of.

Q 
A 
His hands were nowhere near his waist? 
No, his hands never went down towards his

16 or anything.

18 you say he wasn't wearing a belt?

20 was sagging.

22 the picture.

5 about the sagging, we probably all know the kind of,

1 definitely struck with the first shot. So I could 
2 tell he was injured because this hand was a little 
3 lower than this hand. As I'm looking at him, he 
4 said I'm, he didn't say I'm unarmed per se, he said 
5 I don't have a gun, but he's still mad, he still has 
6 his angry face. I don't have a gun. 
7 And he goes, he never started running 
8 because, you know, he's hit, but sort of, I don't 
9 have a gun. And before he can say the second

11 when the several more shots came.

side of Big Mike.

21 I stood and watched face-to-face as every shot was 
22 fired and as his body went down and his body never. 
23 His body kind of just went down and fell, you know, 
24 like a step, you know what I'm saying? Like a step,

already down before the last shot came. 
So he never like got on his knees, he was 
18 just falling down?

20 shots because like I said, I've been shot before. 
21 I'm so face-to-face with him being shot, I'm seeing 
22 his eyes blink and all of these different. It is

1 is firing, it is sickening to my stomach, I'm almost 
2 bursting in tears right there. I threw up a little 
3 in my mouth initially. I got in my head that he's 
4 dead. When I see his body hit the ground, in my 
5 head I say he's dead. 
6 At that time while he's on the 
7 ground, the officer is standing there, he doesn't 
8 look around like he's looking for me or anything 
9 like that, I'm still in plain sight. I never went 
10 anywhere until it clicked back to me that he may 
11 could be looking for you too. 
12 Again, at that time, that's more fear 
13 for my life. I just seen him gun down and kill 
14 someone I was just walking with my friend Big Mike, 
15 I see that, I see with my eyes he killed him. Now

17 me.

What do you mean he just stood there? 
After giving the final shots, the rippling 
4 shots because there is only one rippling shots. 
5 Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, he kind of stood 
6 there. And at that time I see him, and I see Big 
7 Mike on the ground, he's not moving, breathing or 
8 anything like that. I see the officer kind of just 
9 standing there, it wasn't for like a full two 
10 seconds when I took off running, I just 
11 Q So you didn't see the officer when he went 
12 back to his car or when he left the scene or 
13 anything like that? 
14 A No, I didn't see him go back to his car or 
15 anything when I took off running. My building is 
16 right here, I was so afraid for my life that I 
17 didn't want to go to any other direction, so I took 
18 this direction all the way, all the way around. I 
19 went the longest way around to my house. 
20 Now, when I got into my apartment, I 
21 wasn't there for a minute or two, my girlfriend is 
22 there, I'm hyperventilating, I'm still throwing up, 
23 I have been throwing up since I started running. 
24 I've been throwing up all the way along the run.

3 hyperventilating so much that I can't really tell 
4 her, and now I want to see did it really just

6 that just happened. So not a full two minutes

5 A Like I said, when I had got back to my 
6 apartment, hyperventilating, still trying to figure 
7 out. At the scene, I kind of pretty much assumed 
8 that he's dead. But when I ran to my apartment and 
9 I was able to kind of get it together, it wasn't a 
10 minute or two minutes, I came back out to check to 
11 see if he's all right, is he moving or, you know, 
12 did he really get killed. 
13 When I came back out to the street, 
14 you can see where my apartment is, how close the 
15 street is. When I came back out, I came back 
16 straight away. Came back straight away, I got to 
17 about right here and I could still see that Big Mike 
18 was still laying in the street in the same position 
19 he was when he had got shot. But I did not see the 
20 officer any more, I saw his cruiser, his car was 
21 still there, it didn't look like he was inside the 
22 car. 
23 I continued to walk along because now 
24 there is a lot of people outside right now. At this 
25 time when coming back now, there is a lot of people,

3 Q (By Ms. Whirley) That is what my question 
4 was, so there is no police officers on the scene at 
5 this time when you walk back? 
6 A No, ma'am. 
7 Q So there is no tape of anything? 
8 A No tape, nothing right at the moment. At 
9 the moment of me coming back, there was just Big 
10 Mike laying in the street, his car was still there, 
11 but Darren Wilson himself was not present any more, 
12 there was a bunch of other people congregating

19 back around and you were taking a peek at the scene, 
20 did you notice whether the other two cars that were 
21 in the traffic stop, were they still there? 
22 A No. When I came back on the scene, the 
23 rest of the cars, the two cars, they had already 
24 pulled off, I'm assuming they pulled off. The car 
25 was still right there. They had to pull through the

3 Q (By Ms. Whirley) So the road was open 
4 between Michael Brown and the police cruiser, nobody 
5 else on the road? 
6 A Correct, yes, sir. 
7 At any 
8 time from the first time the officer approached you 
9 and Mr. Brown to the time of his death, did he ever 
10 call for help? 
11 A No, ma'am, the officer never got on his 
12 dispatcher or anything like that. He never even 
13 seemed like he really needed any help. We wasn't 
14 threatening his life in a threatening manner. I 
15 definitely wasn't doing anything like assisting Big 
16 Mike in pulling him away. It was more so just him 
17 and Big Mike, I didn't see him needing any help.

3 Can you tell me were you 
4 down on your knees like this, both knees, one knee 
5 down like this or what? 
6 A Yes, ma'am. I never got down on my knees 
7 so much as crouch down slightly, just a little. I 
8 played football in school, so I got a good crouch. 
9 I was just basically standing there. I'm behind the 
10 car, but I know that I'm not low enough because the 
11 car is so small I didn't really want to get down on 
12 the ground. I was just really trying to stoop. 
13 But once Big Mike looked me in my 
14 face as he is going by and says, hey, keep running, 
15 Bro. At that moment I knew this is not a good place 
16 to be, but I could not move because of fear and 
17 shock that I was. My mind was like go, run, go, but 
18 I was just like, uh, I couldn't move at the time.

3 Your back is 
4 to the car? 
5 A Yes, ma'am. 
6 Your back is to the

8 A No, my back was to the car. At that time 
9 when Big Mike passed me, he passed in front of me. 
10 He past in front of me and he was still going and 
11 now at that time my back is towards the officer in

1 fire all of these shots as you are pursuing Mike 
2 Brown, what would you say is the cause of that? 
3 Kind of from what you've seen and everything that 
4 happened, why would you say he was pursuing him? 
5 A You are saying why didn't he fire the 
6 shots from the beginning or from the last couple 
7 shots? 
8 He is out of the vehicle 
9 and he is pursuing as Mike is running, why would you 
10 say, do you have any suspicion? 
11 A I saw no reason possible for him to 
12 actually fire the weapon now. If he would just pull 
13 it out to threaten him to stop running, I could see 
14 him doing that, but I still didn't understand why he 
15 pulled a gun out to threaten somebody to stop him, 
16 but like I said, I didn't see no reason for him to 
17 fire the shots. The first one or the rest of the 
18 ones afterwards. 
19 Thank you. 
20 So you 
21 mentioned that he never said stop or halt when Big 
22 Mike was running? 
23 A Correct, yes, sir. 
24 So I guess the point where 
25 he fired the one shot and he turned around?

2 Leading up to that, you 
3 never heard stop, get on the ground? 
4 A No, sir and like I said, I was still on 
5 the scene to the point where I could, I was still 
6 right in the area and the only thing that I heard 
7 was Big Mike tell me to keep running. After that 
8 there was no more words said by anybody, it was just 
9 shots fired. 
10 I have a 
11 question. You said after the first shot, your ears 
12 were ringing? 
13 
14 
A Yes. 
I've been in close range 
15 with a loud noise, I know it can take a while for 
16 your hearing to fully restore where it is like 
17 cotton or ear plugs, how well did you actually hear 
18 Michael Brown say, keep running, Bro, or was it 
19 really muffled to you. I guess where I'm going with 
20 this, if you really couldn't hear that well, were 
21 you able to hear the officer clearly if he was 
22 saying anything? 
23 A Right, and I understand that. Prior to 
24 the first shot firing off and I got to the car, I 
25 guess the ring, like I said, I've been shot at

1 before, I've been shot once before, but I've been 
2 shot at in crazy situations, walking home from 
3 school and all. 
4 So the ringing affect from gunfire, 
5 it really didn't drown out everything because my 
6 adrenaline was pumping so hard, my mind is going so 
7 many different ways, like survival mode I should 
8 say. So once he says something, I can definitely 
9 hear, I'm like I'm locked in on him and the police 
10 officer, Big Mike and the police officer. 
11 So once he runs by me and says, keep 
12 running, Bro, it is almost clear as us having a 
13 conversation. 
14 As the police officer is walking by, 
15 he's not saying anything so much as focusing on 
16 where he's going because he never once glanced over 
17 at me like Big Mike did. Big Mike actually turned 
18 his head and looked at me and kept running. The 
19 officer walked past me and now that I'm not, I'm not 
20 crouched down lower than I was when Big Mike saw me, 
21 I'm still, is the officer going to see me or what is 
22 he going to do because I know he can see me. What 
23 is he going to say. He never said anything, never 
24 look towards me, he just kept walking past me.

1 the scene to verify that what you thought happened 
2 did indeed happen, what did you do then when you see 
3 him laying, and there is no police there, what do 
4 you do? 
5 A At that time I kind of stood back into the 
6 crowd of people that is starting to come out now 
7 because at that time now, police officer was coming. 
8 At that time it wasn't Darren Wilson who came back, 
9 it was some other officer. 
10 He initially started putting up the 
11 tape around the area. At that time it was, he was 
12 by hisself. 
13 So the family and people, I could 
14 tell it was his family. They were trying to get 
15 information from that officer who had just got on 
16 the scene, so he really didn't know anything that 
17 happened. So he's basically telling them to get 
18 back, get back, move away and move away. I'm just 
19 standing there like if this is his family and all 
20 they want to know is why their son is laying in the 
21 street uncovered. He wasn't covered at that time. 
22 Everyone is taking pictures of him 
23 and stuff like that, he's not covered, he's bleeding 
24 everything, he's out in the open. The parents want 
25 to know why, they're asking this officer who is on

1 the scene caution up, he's not telling them 
2 anything, he has no information. Darren Wilson 
3 wasn't there to tell him anything, you know, he was 
4 gone. 
5 His car was still there, they 
6 actually had to take some caution tape over his car 
7 because they left it there at that time so his car 
8 was still there. It was cautioned off, but when I 
9 saw that they were not giving, you know, the parents 
10 what happened or anything like that and I was kind 
11 of waiting to see if they were, if anybody were 
12 going to come out to speak to them and say anything, 
13 no one said anything. 
14 Q Did you make contact with the police to 
15 let them know what was going on? 
16 A At that time I was real fearful, I was 
17 more scared of police. I should say I didn't want 
18 them to know when I ran the first time, everyone was 
19 saying well, there was somebody with him, he ran so 
20 fast we couldn't tell who it was, that's how fast I 
21 was running. Even people who see me every day in my 
22 complex didn't know it was me running. 
23 Q Who was the first person that you talked 
24 to about what happened? 
25 A I had, I went to his grandmother's house.

13 be seen right now. I don't want to be detained in 
14 any type of way, you know. It was just a lot at the 
15 time and I was just in the crowd. 
16 Even so, no one was asking for me or 
17 looking for me really, they was just trying to 
18 patrol the area what was going on. 
19 Q Did you learn a day or two afterwards that 
20 the police were wanting to get your statement? 
21 A I didn't, a couple, three or four days, it 
22 wasn't until I had my lawyer, that really was what 
23 my concern was, I wait until I got a lawyer so that 
24 I can, if they were looking for me, they wanted me. 
25 I can go to my lawyer, here is what happen. I have

2 like that. 
3 At the time I didn't have nobody 
4 representing me, I didn't have no one even caring if 
5 it was me there or not.

7 that the police came to

14 
Q 
A 
Not on the 11th, nobody came? 
Probably so because I don't know if I was 
15 going to stay there on the 11th. When I came out, 
16 the next day after this on the lOth, people thought 
17 I was dead. Because they said that they found a 
18 body, that is what happened, they found a body

9 girlfriend to your knowledge?

Not with her or me. 
So when did you first talk to the police? 
The first police that I did talk to was 
13 the FBI and St. Louis County, and that was four days 
14 prior to them releasing the video, so four days 
15 before that, I had my talk with the FBI. 
16 Q 
17 probably?

A

So that would have been the 13th of August 
Yeah, the 13th. 
Okay. And so, even though the county 
20 police, you know, the county police had taken over 
21 the investigation? 
22 A Well, I was out there long enough to see 
23 the county actually come in and Ferguson leave, I 
24 saw all of that.

1 to get you to get a statement, but you just weren't

3 A At the time, no, I wasn't aware of that, 
4 that the county was looking for me or they wanted me 
5 for questioning or anything like that. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Can I ask a question?

8 right by the police vehicle and you see these three 
9 cars come up?

A Yes, ma'am.

12 cars coming from that direction? 
13 A At that time, actually, through the 
14 incident, no cars were coming in that direction. 
15 There was no one trying to get over even though I 
16 could see the police squad car is on the opposite 
17 side of the line as well, but no one came. There 
18 was no one held up that way. 
19 MS. ALIZADEH: When you ran after the 
20 police officer shot Mike and you ran away, you ran 
21 kind of around, did you run around the police car, 
22 is that the line you drew? 
23 A That the tape, that's me here and that's 
24 run all the way around.

It did come out, but I didn't get it out 
8 loud where someone would have heard it, I was just, 
9 killed my friend. You know, I was still 
10 hyperventilating, but it didn't come out a clear

1 question for you. You talked about Michael Brown 
2 said something, exchange words with the officer 
3 during the tug of war at the car, you heard him say 
4 something. And you heard him say something towards 
5 the end right before he was killed, you didn't hear 
6 the officer say anything during that tug of war or 
7 anything during that entire time that he was coming 
8 down the street. 
9 A I didn't hear him, no, when he was coming 
10 down the street after he got out of the car he said 
11 nothing, I didn't see his mouth move. I was there 
12 looking at him, his mouth wasn't moving, he didn't 
13 say freeze or anything like that before he fired the 
14 second shot, which made him stop. 
15 And the car, because of the, I'm not 
16 used to seeing, I see police officers get into it 
17 with people before, I'm not use in that manner 
18 sitting in his car, tug of war and all of that, I'm 
19 not used to seeing it like that. 
20 I'm not focused so much on what they 
21 said, so much as saying who was going to calm down, 
22 who was going to give in to the words because that 
23 is all it was at the car was just words. There was 
24 no physical altercation really as much as the 
25 pulling of the arm, but so much as words being said

1 in a very aggressive manner. 
2 Nothing like, no threatening manner 
3 like I'll kill you, or let me go or I'll punch you. 
4 Let me the F go, get the F off of me, and what the 
5 officer said, I couldn't really make what he was 
6 saying, I heard him cussing also, he had a very 
7 angry face. 
8 Once he exited the car, 
9 you didn't hear the officer say anything? 
10 A Once he got out of the car after the shot 
11 was fired, he didn't instantly get out of the car 
12 when we ran, it took him like a minute maybe, or 
13 some seconds to get out of the car, that's how I was 
14 able to get to where I was able to position myself. 
15 I didn't hear the door open until 
16 after Big Mike was passing me telling me to keep 
17 running. I hear the door and now, I didn't look 
18 back at the time, so I'm not really sure if it was 
19 his door or the people's door whose car I'm hiding 
20 behind, but I hear a door open and slam. And almost 
21 seconds later, I see the officer walking past me, so 
22 I kind of figure he was getting out of his car at 
23 that time. 
24 MS. ALIZADEH: Dorian, you said it took 
25 almost a minute for him to get out of the car?

5 got out of the car. 
6 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. Now, you said 
7 earlier that he never radioed for help, is it 
8 possible while he was in the car, that's what he was 
9 doing?

11 him not instantly getting out of the car he was

20 chance to smoke the weed? 
21 A We never got a chance to do anything. We 
22 never got a chance to make it back to the house. 
23 MS. ALIZADEH: Were you two ever apart 
24 during that day, like where he could have been doing

4 saw him in the morning? 
5 A From the time I saw him, we was together 
6 from seven all the way to him dying. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
8 You 
9 said several times that the police officer didn't 
10 say stop or freeze or halt or whatever, but he did 
11 say twice I'll shoot, I'll shoot you. 
12 A He said it fully once. The second time he 
13 didn't really get it out before the shot. It was 
14 almost like --
15 The first time he said 
16 I'll shoot, his gun went off and the second time the 
17 officer pulled his weapon out and said the second 
18 time I'll shoot you. What did you think that meant, 
19 did you not think that meant to stop? 
20 A When someone says I'll shoot? 
21 I'll shoot you, when a

1 A That means get out of the way, either get 
2 out of the way or protect ourself because, you know, 
3 if he really wanted to stop. They have a lot of 
4 phrases that they teach the first day at the academy

6 I'm sure like you go through some 
7 type of simulation to where any, you know, any 
8 altercation they have they might already been 
9 through a simulation or something like that in 
10 training to where he knows how you are supposed to 
11 handle a situation as opposed to just pulling his 
12 gun on people who doesn't have guns drawn on him, 
13 who don't have weapons drawn down on him. 
14 I'm not saying anything at all, he's 
15 not, he's yelling, but he's not making any 
16 threatening remarks towards the officer, so there 
17 was no need for him to draw his gun in the first 
18 manner, and that's what it really became. Oh, let 
19 me get away because now it is starting to get out of 
20 hand either furthermore the argument. And that was 
21 in itself and I see that you could of, I'm not going 
22 to say what he should of did or could have did

1 was, it was out of order. Could have been a taser, 
2 anything that made someone stop. The taser make me 
3 stop, anything less lethal than a gun. He could 
4 have pulled out the billy club to show he was going 
5 to use force if we didn't stop.

8 need to stop?

A If you're not doing anything wrong. 
If you are running, you 
11 continue running when the police say I shoot?

14 shoot, oh, yeah, I'll stop. I don't want to get

16 on you. 
17 What did he say the

20 standing at the car. He said it first, he said I'll

22 aiming at us, he's not, you know, out of his car, we 
23 are still standing right there. The second time he

20 where it looked like he got hit in his back, but I 
21 knew, it maybe could have grazed him, but he 
22 definitely made a jerking movement. He didn't take

Away from the officer? 
MS. ALIZADEH: Yeah. 
No, after the second shot was fired, that 
5 literally stopped him in his tracks and turned 
6 around at that point. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Then when you saw him turn 
8 around, is it possible that he ran, not ran, at that 
9 point he stopped running, right? 
10 
11 
A Right. 
MS. ALIZADEH: Is it possible that he 
12 moved maybe 20, 22 feet toward the officer before he 
13 fell? 
14 A Not 20 to 22, not that far. Like I said, 
15 he was barely on the sidewalk, he was barely on the 
16 sidewalk to the parking lot. He was going towards 
17 this building. I presume that's the way he was 
18 running. He wasn't really all the way on the 
19 driveway when the second shot went off, and he 
20 turned around, and he was in the street. 
21 He was taking a step towards the 
22 officer to show him that he didn't have anything, 
23 his hand was up, so he is showing the officer, I 
24 don't have a weapon on me. 
25 And as he's walking toward the

1 officer saying that in an angry manner, he was 
2 saying it an angry manner, he was hurt, still 
3 frustrated probably, so he's telling him, I don't 
4 have a gun. I don't have before he can say, you 
5 know, anything else, this man is riddled with more 
6 shots until he tumbled other. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: He doesn't like run at the 
8 officer? 
9 A No, ma'am. At no point in time when he 
10 turned around he made a rush towards the officer or 
11 anything like he was going to tackle the officer or 
12 anything like that. He was standing straight up. 
13 MS. ALIZADEH: He maybe got like a step 
14 you said before the gunshots? 
15 A Before the several shots came. That was 
16 the only time it came repeatedly, boom, boom, boom, 
17 boom, boom, and he went down and that was it. He 
18 wasn't moving any more. 
19 MS. WHIRLEY: I don't know who was first. 
20 When the 
21 second shot was fired by Darren Wilson, where was he 
22 related to his patrol car, was he right next to his 
23 patrol car? 
24 A The officer? 
25 Yes, on the second shot.

1 A Oh, no. The second shot, like I said, 
2 once he got fully out of the patrol car, he never 
3 turned back to it or got back in it. He came away 
4 from the patrol car and like I said, feet and 
5 distances are rough to me right now. 
6 I definitely know that his patrol car 
7 was in front of this driveway and in front of this 
8 building, and when he shot the second shot he was at 
9 the end of the building. 
10 That being said, 
11 going the same direction, they 
12 found two bullet casings near the car. Do you have 
13 any idea, any speculation why they find two bullet 
14 casings at the car when you only heard one shot. 
15 A I honestly do not know. He definitely 
16 only shot one time inside the car, it wasn't 
17 multiple shots. If they found, I mean, we don't 
18 have forensics both shells match his gun. If they 
19 did, I was lost after the first shot. That just 
20 shows how much more shock I was in because I 
21 definitely know he shot once, I wasn't aware of a 
22 second shot at the car.

1 motion when all the shots were fired, we'll see 
2 where the wounds are, my thought was from the 
3 turning, you were demonstrating the turning, I just 
4 want to make sure. I don't know if you want to show 
5 us, you are saying he is walking like this, you are 
6 saying that second shot came on this side and then 
7 that he turned? 
8 A Yes. 
9 And the rest were on this 
10 side? 
11 A Well, he was running away, I didn't see 
12 where the bullet struck him. 
13 Okay. 
14 A That's why I was trying to go back, but I 
15 definitely saw the officer fire his gun while his 
16 back was towards us, and both me and the officer, I 
17 saw his body jerk. If he was struck, I don't know 
18 if he was fully struck or he just grazed him, but 
19 that's what stopped him in his tracks from running 
20 away from the second shot.

2 Mike was laying in the street? 
3 A Oh, yes, there was people crossing, no one 
4 actually got close to his body, but people were 
5 walking through the street, back and forth across 
6 the side. 
7 They would get on the sidewalk as 
8 close they wanted to, but they wouldn't get in the 
9 street by the body. They got pretty close to get 
10 some real crazy pictures of his body. 
11 MS. WHIRLEY: Was there anything stopping 
12 them from getting up to his body before when it 
13 first happened because you said there were no police 
14 cars there initially? 
15 A Nothing stopped anybody from the public 
16 coming up to the dead body and just looking at it. 
17 It was uncovered, his body was not covered at the 
18 time, there was no police officers out there, 
19 nobody, just the squad car. And he was not there, 
20 there was no yellow tape. So people were just 
21 coming out their doors, kids, you know, there is a 
22 lot of kids out. 
23 Just looking at the dead body, like 
24 he is right here laying in front of us, that's how 
25 people were able to walk up and look at his body,

5 walking around coming out of that building, oh, it 
6 is a dead body in our street. They are walking up 
7 to it like it is a prank or something like that. 
8 No, this is a real dead person, he's 
9 not covered, his pants down are by his knees, you 
10 could see the blood spilling from his top part, not 
11 out of his head, but you can tell that it is blood 
12 leaking because it is all coming from the top part.

1 actually, there was only one that they spewed to the 
2 public. It was the private autopsy where it said he 
3 got shot in his face. It came out and went back in, 
4 got shot in the top of his head. That's the only 
5 one that I saw that they was releasing to the 
6 public. 
7 MS. ALIZADEH: Did you see an actual

9 was on the news. I mean, they were speaking on the

11 
12 
A Like the documentation of it, no, ma'am. 
MS. ALIZADEH: So you are basing that on

15 the media, the private examiner that was hired by 
16 the family. And I'm sure his credentials follow him 
17 wherever he goes. I know he is not random that's

1 MS. WHIRLEY: You mentioned something, you 
2 know, the grand jurors may want to factor. You said 
3 something about a criminal record? 
4 A Yes, because I stay watching the news and 
5 media outlets. I see they dug through years in my 
6 past to see an incident that happened in Jefferson 
7 City, but what they fail, they keep leaving out is I 
8 was a freshman in college at this time, everybody 
9 makes, you know, crazy little moves their freshman 
10 year. I was just beginning, I was getting out, I 
11 was breaking out of my kid years, you know, just 
12 being on my own around new people, Atlanta people, 
13 Washington people, people I never see on a daily 
14 basis, I'm from St. Louis. 
15 So to hold that against me and 
16 Michael Brown on a day that has nothing to do with 
17 it, I feel like it is very wrong, especially for 
18 them not to dig two or three years prior and in 
19 Darren Wilson's file and see if any complaints were 
20 made against him. Basically all I keep seeing is 
21 slander on my name. 
22 Q (By Ms. Whirley) We don't want to slander 
23 you, but we just want all the information you can 
24 get. What is the nature of the thing in Jefferson

1 A There was just basically me walking with a 
2 group of kids that I knew, we were going to a YMCA 
3 to play basketball. I didn't have membership there. 
4 They actually had membership there. So we are 
5 walking through some apartments, one of the guys, 
6 you know, he grabbed a package and, you know, he 
7 ripped it opened. As we are walking towards the 
8 YMCA, I see a pool guy, he sees us, but he doesn't 
9 see anything in our hand or anything like that, but 
10 he sees us walking from out of the apartments going 
11 towards the gym. 
12 So I guess whoever's package it was, 
13 they made the call saying someone had stole 
14 something off their property or something like that. 
15 And I guess he took it in his own 
16 mind that I just saw these guys coming out of those 
17 apartments. When they went to run the YMCA cameras 
18 to see who had just recently walked in, I did not 
19 pay to get in, even though I was supposed to. I 
20 kind of just walked right on past, go down to the 
21 gym, play basketball. 
22 And when the police came and they ran 
23 the camera back and they saw like he didn't pay or 
24 this group right here, they came down, they grabbed 
25 basically the last group.

I had a false report to an officer, I had

8 was the one that had stole it. I was going to 
9 court. At that time of me leaving court, I had been 
10 fed up with being stopped by off campus police and 
11 on campus police because of the stereotypical they 
12 look at people from St. Louis. And being stopped 
13 everyday, being late for class and having to remake

19 lot done down here in St. Louis. I don't have a 
20 charge for the City or County of St. Louis, but when 
21 they run my name, they see Jefferson City. They 
22 detain me sometimes, some police officers let me go. 
23 A couple police officers they detain me. Jefferson 
24 City, they never come and get me. The warrant is a 
25 500 mile, my lawyer reached out to them, if you are

MS. WHIRLEY: 50 miles. 2 
3 A 50 miles, we are not coming to get you. 
4 I'm sure the other police officers they see that, 
5 but they always detain me and they hold me. 
6 MS. WHIRLEY: You were never on probation 
7 for that? 
8 A When I got locked up, when I had got 
9 locked up, I got to the Jefferson City probation 
10 about the stealing, I guess I was in the middle of 
11 asking the judge can I do my probation in St. Louis 
12 because I was not from Jefferson City and in the 
13 middle of that we kind of lost contact, lost 
14 communication. 
15 MS. WHIRLEY: It was probation, you had 
16 resolved it through probation? 
17 
18 
A Right. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Was it a felony or 
19 misdemeanor? 
20 
21 
A It was a misdemeanor.

1 mentioned the stealing thing and then you said a 
2 false police report? 
3 A Yes. 
4 MS. ALIZADEH: Is that the same incident 
5 or was that a separate thing? 
6 A That was the same incident with the 
7 officer who actually had me, he put me in the car, 
8 took me down to the station. I had both my school 
9 campus ID and my state ID in possession of me. When 
10 the officer asked me my name, I didn't say anything 
11 so much as just handed him my identification. I was 
12 mad at the time, again, I was a freshman in college, 
13 I'm kind of angry with the police, so I don't really 
14 want to say anything to them, but I know what he is 
15 going to ask me for my identification. 
16 So I hand him my school ID and both 
17 my state ID at the same time. He is looking at both 
18 of them, he's looking at me. I have a very 
19 distinguished feature about me, I have one of my 
20 eyes, I have a cataract, one of them is blue and the 
21 other one is brown. It is like that on both my 
22 picture ID, I have distinguish color on my eyes. 
23 So I'm sure he can see that, in my 
24 mind I know he can see it, I know he can tell that 
25 this is me, who I am. He actually called campus

1 security from Lincoln University, they also came 
2 down and verified that's him, you know, we seem him 
3 walking around on campus. But because I never said 
4 nothing to the officer, he took that as 
5 disobedience. 
6 And he was like, you are not going to 
7 tell me anything, so I'm just going to write down 
8 that you gave me a false report. Me being a 
9 freshman and not really wanting to talk to him, I 
10 just kind of shrug my shoulders not thinking too 
11 much of it until it got to court and it was like 
12 this is serious, but the judge, he threw that one 
13 out of court. I never got charged for that or 
14 anything.

MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. 
MS. WHIRLEY: Anything else? Dorian, we 
17 appreciate you coming.
