5 is a little after it is 8:50 a.m. Sheila Whirley is

7 witness of the morning, who will be 
8 And all 12 grand jurors are present, as the court 
9 reporter's also present and taking things down. 
10 We just had a brief conversation before we 
11 got started about transcripts and listening to 
12 witness' statements, about best way to proceed with 
13 that. And during our lunch break today, I'm going 
14 to do everything I can to make sure I have 
15 transcripts for statements. Some of our statements 
16 do not have transcripts. We have played some 
17 statements that we didn't have transcripts for and 
18 we may now have those transcripts as they have all 
19 been kind of getting done along the way. So I will 
20 make sure that we have transcripts for all the 
21 statements that we have for every witness.

A 
Q 
Page 67

8 
9 
A 
Q 
A 
Q

Initially.

You realized he wasn't shot in the back, 
15 does that make sense with what you saw? 
16 A Yes, it does, it makes sense, it does, it 
17 makes sense to coincide with what I thought. 
18 Q Okay. Now, did you see anyone with 
19 Michael Brown when you saw this incident occurring? 
20 A No, ma'am. All I seen was Mike Brown 
21 running eastbound on the street. 
22 Q And tell me again why you believe that he 
23 was hit before he turned around? We now know he 
24 wasn't shot in his back. You said you believe he 
25 was shot in his back, why did you think he was hit

1 before he turned around? 
2 A Because I heard gunshots, you know, I 
3 heard the gunshot and when he turned around, I 
4 figure he was hit. And so he immediately submitted, 
5 subdued hisself like, okay, this is real, you know. 
6 Q You didn't see anything that gave you the 
7 impression that he was injured? 
8 A No, I did not. I didn't see no physical 
9 indication on his body whatsoever based on distance. 
10 Q Okay. Was it strange to you that he was 
11 walking towards the police officer? 
12 A No, it was not because he was ready to, I 
13 guess, give hisself up from running based on being 
14 grazed by the bullet and I did not know that 
15 information until, like you said, the autopsy came 
16 out. 
17 Q But, I mean, with his hands up and walking 
18 towards the officer, what was your thinking when you 
19 saw him do that?

A bunch of lies? 
Well, you told them that you saw the

19 that? 
20 A Well, you know, I did say that, but it was

2 A I told them in the second meeting with the 
3 FBI, we all sat down and it was solely based on 
4 assumption because I'm not able to be at a point to 
5 where I'm not able to see. I told them based on

17 to clarify the first recording.

19 that, by the time you gave the second interview, at 
20 that point you had seen on the news there was an 
21 autopsy? 
22 A Once again, I did not look at the TV or

to say that when he was running away,

Q 
A 
Q 
Well --
-- let me finish my question. 
Okay. 
So you are basing this on, not your 
the 
your 
14 personal observation, but on just things that you 
15 heard in the media? 
16 A It is concrete once the autopsy come out. 
17 I can assume anything based on me looking, I don't 
18 know, I don't know where the bullet was landing. 
19 Q Didn't you say in your second interview 
20 you admitted that those things that you said you saw 
21 you really didn't see them and you were basing it on 
22 what you had seen in the media? 
23 A That was the truth based on the autopsy 
24 coming back. I don't have no knowledge of giving 
25 autopsy, so yeah.

1 Q So it was after you learned that the 
2 things that you said you saw couldn't of had 
3 happened that way, then you changed your story about 
4 what you seen? 
5 A Yeah, to coincide with what really 
6 happened. 
7 Q So is what you're testifying about today 
8 what you really saw or you also basing your 
9 testimony today 
A I'm not --10 
11 Q -- let me finish my question. Are you 
12 also basing your testimony today on things that you 
13 assumed? 
14 A You know, it is not a thing of assumption, 
15 based on being in the position when it happened in 
16 the beginning because I don't know where the bullets 
17 was flying to, I can only assume that they landed 
18 where they landed. 
19 And that wasn't the truth of the 
20 matter being the autopsy came out and gave clarity 
21 based on what I thought I saw. The autopsy didn't 
22 lie. I didn't know in the beginning, I was full of 
23 emotion and I knew that this individual was getting 
24 shot. So I assume the portions of the body that I 
25 named, he was getting shot. The autopsy came out to

1 where it clarified everything where he got shot at 
2 so. 
3 Q So you assumed when you made your first 
4 statement that the officer stood over him and empty 
5 his clip into him and finished him off? 
6 A Once again, based on me being in 
7 and that's , I can only assume. I can 
8 only assume. 
9 Q Why did you assume that? 
10 A Because some individual getting shot by 
11 police, it was like, really, this just didn't 
12 happen. 
13 Q I mean, don't you think is it possible 
14 that you said that because that's what other people 
15 were saying they seen? 
16 A I didn't base that on anybody else's 
17 knowledge of. I only based it on my assumption, 
18 once again, because I'm in and that's 
19 and that's a blind spot. I only assume 
20 based on bullets being fired and a dead body laying 
21 on the ground. 
22 Q You never saw Michael Brown fall on the 
23 street? 
24 A No, I did not. I can only assume that he 
25 did because of the bullets that was due to his body.

Page 79 
And you said that you could clearly hear 
2 Michael Brown saying the thing he said screaming, 
3 right? 
4 A He yelled, don't shoot me, stop shooting. 
5 Q You remember in your first interview 
6 Michael Brown put his hands up and said okay? 
7 A He was saying that too as well as the 
8 bullets was going off of his body, okay, he was 
9 saying okay. 
10 Q You never told the agent in your first 
11 interview that he was saying don't shoot me, you 
12 said he was saying okay. 
13 A I never told him in the first interview? 
14 Q Yes. Do you recall? 
15 A It comes out, to actually see somebody get 
16 gunned down, you might miss a couple of things, you 
17 know, because it's just a shock to see an officer 
18 shoot somebody the way he did. So you might forget 
19 something. 
20 Q And I'm going to correct myself, I've got 
21 my notes from your first interview. You said 
22 Michael Brown said don't shoot, and then you said 
23 you saw him fall to the ground and the officer 
24 continue to shoot him. The officer stood over him 
25 and finished him off in the head.

2 A At that point you're saying I didn't know 
3 there was shot to his back? 
4 Q Well, in your second interview you talk to 
5 about the fact you knew he was grazed 
6 in arm because of the autopsy? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q You knew about the autopsy results during 
9 your second interview? 
10 A Based on what I seen with the graze on the 
11 arm and him turning around. As far as the other 
12 bullets are concerned, I wasn't concerned about them 
13 because of the fact the closure of the bullets, I 
14 was only concern of the graze of the arm based on 
15 his turning around and putting his arms up and what 
16 I seen when he was walking toward the police. He 
17 was getting shot in the upper torso and lower torso, 
18 that's all I can give you based on me visualizing 
19 and seeing what I saw, that's it. 
20 I can't give you the closure of him 
21 standing over him and finish him off with a head 
22 shot. I don't know. I don't know. I assume, once 
23 again, based on me being where I was at in

25 can only assume by common sense that occurred.

A I seen him get shot in his upper torso. 
Okay. And what makes you 
14 say he got shot, did you see the holes, did you see 
15 the blood? 
16 A The distance between the officer and 
17 Michael Brown and where he had his gun raised, I 
18 seen him physically get shot in his upper torso. 
19 Okay. And you say he was 
20 moving toward the police with his arms up and he was 
21 not posing a threat? 
22 
23 
A None whatsoever. 
Okay. And I'm going to 
24 ask you this, and I believe you, but you live there 
25 so you knew he wasn't a threat to you, but if you

1 were a police officer and he's still moving toward 
2 you, how could you be sure that the police officer 
3 didn't think he was a threat? If I were being shot 
4 and I were being shot at, even though I had my hands 
5 up, I'd get on the ground. 
6 Couldn't it be possible, why didn't he 
7 stop moving? I mean, it would seem to me that there 
8 could still be perceived as a threat if he's still 
9 moving toward the police officer and the police 
10 officer is backing up. Look at it from another 
11 point, I just want you to tell me if it's possible? 
12 A It may be possible in your world. 
13 In my world? 
14 A Yeah. 
15 Okay. What does that 
16 mean? 
17 A That means that you more than likely not 
18 to be shot the way he was shot. So he did not know, 
19 being as young as he is, not knowing the seriousness 
20 the situation. After getting pierced with the gun, 
21 his torso to get down on his knees because he's 
22 thinking to hisself, I'm assuming that this officer

1 wouldn't you want to get down on the ground? 
2 A Immediately, but he did not know, 
3 apparently, he did not know to get down on the 
4 ground. 
5 So I want to ask you a 
6 question. Again, about that, and you say it was 
7 quite a distance that he moved toward the police 
8 officer, 50 to 100 feet? 
9 A Uh-huh. 
10 Okay. And at that point 
11 he was out of your sight? 
12 
13 
A Uh-huh, correct. 
So you don't know, he's 
14 moving toward the police officer, even though he has 
15 his hands up, he's still moving towards him. 
16 A After getting shot in the upper torso. 
17 After getting shot in the 
18 upper torso, how many times has he been shot? 
19 A I say, I say, about four times, I think 
20 about. 
21 Four times in upper 
22 torso? 
23 A Two upper torso and two down lower 
24 portion. At that point it becomes a blind spot once

2 times, he's still moving forward, he hasn't gotten 
3 down on the ground, and then he gets out of your 
4 sight and you do not know what happens after that. 
5 You don't know if his hands went down, you don't

7 were up and he was still moving forward.

1 little bit of a break so we could print-out some 
2 transcripts because the grand jurors have asked to 
3 listen to the recorded statement of 
4 that was made to the FBI on September 30th. So we 
5 have that disc queued, it is about 22 minutes. We 
6 were going to try to play that before lunch, we 
7 didn't get to it because we were busy making the 
8 copies. You all still want to start that or do you 
9 want lunch. It is not out there right now. So go 
10 ahead and start this? 
11 The only other thing, and Sheila and I had 
12 a discussion about this before now is, she and I are 
13 going to kind of wing how we are doing this, after 
14 testified and she had come here with 
15 who she said was her godson and were 
16 in the waiting room here and testified after 
17 she did. 
18 So when we walked out and we were 
19 kind of saying goodbye to them and they were getting 
20 ready to walk out , I made the comment 
21 about how it is too bad there weren't surveillance 
22 cameras in the complex. 
23 And then said that she had video 
24 the entire thing on her phone and I said, what 
25 portion, what part did you video the whole thing I

1 said the shooting, you have the shooting taped on 
2 your phone. And she said yes, but I dropped the 
3 phone in the toilet. 
4 MS. WHIRLEY: Then I asked her, you know, 
5 where is the phone, thinking we might be able to 
6 recover it with forensic examination. She said it 
7 is in the junk yard. She got so mad she threw it 
8 away. 
9 MS. ALIZADEH: This is information that 
10 I've never known about.

13 about this, and from my observation of her godson 
14 , he was, this was news to him as well 
15 because he asked her where is the phone and, you 
16 know, he seemed to indicate that he had not heard 
17 that information before.

19 know that. 
20 
21

MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila and I kind of 
22 unwittingly became witness to that statement. I 
23 don't think it is appropriate that we testify as

5 so that you could make a decision amongst yourselves

15 what you all are going to have to discuss amongst 
16 yourselves what she testified to, I believe I asked 
17 her if she was wearing the camcorder when the 
18 shooting occurred, and she said no. I think she 
19 said it was in her house, she said that during the 
20 first interview she was in her pajamas when they 
21 came.

11 have to do that. I will tell you that I think that
